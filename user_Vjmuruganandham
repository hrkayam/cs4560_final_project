Flair checks out 
Timberwolves kat Wiggins Bennett at one point 
Laker fan here how the hell is westbrook chosen over booker 
I d want us to keep boogie just to keep AD happy Also having him on our roster despite his injury could convince him to his contract for a one year cheap deal 
Sure he s injured and no one knows how he ll return but I rather take a chance on him than half the available centers we would be able to sign if he walks 
This is quite normal at around the week mark 
This is around the time that the cilia in your lungs start working again and start to remove all the tar and other gunk that s stuck to your lungs 
When it does that you usually ignore it when awake it gives the person the taste and smell of the cigarette 
Thus when you re sleeping your subconscious creates the image of smoking a cigarette in your dream because the other sense of smell and taste attribute this feeling to smoking a cigarette 
This is why the dream is so intense and vivid because it combines your image with the other senses of taste and smell 
It s actually Avery Bradley not rondo at the corner just FYI 
I think he gave that logic to explain why the suns would top the division with a win even though teams suns lakers clippers would have the same record 
It s not about understanding email functions it s more about informing everyone the reply seemed relevant to 
For example Usually at work when I get asked a question regarding certain topics 
it s hardly ever addressed to just me it usually has the senders manager my manager and the product manager and sometimes even the customer depending on confidentiality 
Think Will s original email When I respond I reply all to let all the concerned parties involved know the appropriate answer 
Think archies reply Now I could just respond to the sender and leave it at that but then or days later I might get another email from my manager or the sender s manager asking whether the question has been answered which is something I would like to avoid 
The only difference between this situation and the scenario I created above is that when Will cc ed everyone in his original email it didn t get delivered to you due to lack of authorization but Archie has no way of knowing that 
I get why so many people are annoyed by this but maybe THIS INSTANCE of using reply all may not necessarily be the fault of the administration Will clearly sent the inquiry email to the administration with the full intent of letting everyone who was CC ed in that email know 
However since Will s email does not have the authorization of sending emails to the group in question none of you got that email 
Despite this when the email reached the intended recipient Archie Archie saw that this email was not only addressed to him but also other people 
Unfortunately Archie did not realize that will s email had not delivered to the people and assumed it had 
Hence this is why Archie used the reply all button to let everyone who Archie thought had gotten will s email know that will s question had been answered 
The NFL teams have one game a week and each round in the playoffs are elimination games so not really a comparison 
Your wish is granted https 

Yeah but on that note it s easier to stay motivated when your team keeps winning which is definitely something we can provide for him 
You must be trolling you honestly believe terry rozier is better than Ingram 
Dude last season couldn t even average shooting 
That includes wide open shots also on defense he s holding his opponents to shooting from the field which is at or slightly above average 
Ingram on the other hand is known to be a proven scorer with points on near shooting and he holds his opponents to a little over shooting His biggest issues are point shooting and staying healthy 
The vet min and most other exceptions like MLE prorated throughput the season 
So by the time mid season when the buyouts happen the vet min would be worth significantly less The disabled player exception on the other hand does not prorate it will be mil regardless of at which point in the season it s used 
My bad it s Godwin 
team half PPR snake Pick year for me QB Wilson RB Elliot Gurly WR Cooper Goodwin TE Hunter Henry Flex Lindsay K Tucker Defense Seattle advice please 
it s not a good idea to just use analytics and nothing else but no team does in Sam 
Man if you did the AD trade using trade override you overpaid like hell 
Come on you must be trolling 
Michael Jordan played seasons and by looking at the record he has gone to finals 
So that s at a rate of 
That means on average MJ went to the finals every seasons Lebron has played seasons and by looking at the record he has gone to finals 
So that s at a rate of 
Lebron went to the finals every years Sure you can argue that MJ is in the finals 
But are you really judging overall greatness with as little a sample size as more series wins 
Need I mention MJ s coach was Phil Jackson 
When was the last time Lebron had a coach of Phil Jackson s caliber 
I m not saying lebrons the absolute GOAT 
But you can t argue he doesn t make a strong case for it given his accolades 
Exactly if we want good role players we re gon na have to overpay them to beat the market anyway I rather we have Russell and a bunch of vet mins when we re over the cap we can potentially attract better role players next year a la MLE and a shot at a championship 
Good Role players will be there every year but solid players usually won t be available 
Yeah I m referring to how the clippers are supposed to sign everyone 
This is looking like us back in we were supposedly getting everyone but in the end got no one 
What makes it a shit class 
I get that some labs and the project can be frustrating at times but overall I enjoyed the class 
Yeah and then they trade you when it becomes time to pay you 
On one hand I m laughing at the suns on another I m crying we couldn t get TJ Warren and the if all it took was cash considerations 
I actually thought we would contend for the seed and Clarkson would lead us to at least the second round 
I would like to see kuz to play something similar to Lamar Odom when he was man 
I get the but where is his D https 
I said the same thing about Harrison Barnes and his million 
Overpaying as the media calls it I still don t think we overpaid for Davis was our safest option 
If we don t do the Davis trade it creates more locker room tension from all the negotiation rumors and also puts us at risk of acquiring another max player to pair with lebron 
Regardless of multiple rumors stating that many free agents wan na come to play in LA we have had the track record of striking out which means another wasted year of lebron 
This trade essentially ensures that we have another incredibly good player to go with lebron and makes the third max just a luxury rather than a need 
We could still do very well with a tandem of lebron and AD with good role players surrounding them 
Also this is the best year to risk it all considering the injury to KD and klay TLDR this is the best move we could do and we got it done 
No I m saying that you should try to build a balanced team rather than a full all star lineup so that if one good player gets injured you have a serviceable backup Edit I m speaking completely in hindsight when they initially created the lineup I thought they were brilliant too 
The Raptors win shows that having good depth is way more important than having multiple all stars it sucks that a bunch of the warriors starters went down at crucial times 
However when you frontload a team like that you should know that a couple injuries can seriously destroy your teams chances 
Warriors took the risk and it didn t pay off unfortunately 
I m down 
They wouldnt need a trade if they wait one year they can sign him by just renouncing Ingram s rights and declining the team options 
Technically they can sign a guy for the mil max this season and their young core next offseason to make space for AD but they essentially lose one year of a big 
Why I prefer AD over Beal even if it costs us more assets 
AD has a better chance at with us more so than Beal 
Also AD is a top player in the league which adds pedigree to our team and could attract better free agents than Beal 
AD is a two way player and looking at our coaching hires a player who can defend at a higher level seems to be the preferred asset 
Offensively assuming this roster is being constructed to win the finals other teams are much better equipped to defend Beal than they are in defending AD 
So while Beal and AD are both gifted offensively klay would be better at defending Beal than Draymond would at defending AD so while in theory AD and Beal might have similar offensive production the oppositions matchups make AD the better matchup against other teams 
Why would they need to match salaries if they re under the cap 
Just curious idk how that works 
I think he s referring to lebron 
No I meant a restricted free agent I was just wondering what would happen if a player refused to sign any offer sheet as a restricted free agent you ve cleared it up 
Thanks 
I mean is a slim chance but it s a chance nonetheless why would lakers getting a pick mean that it s rigged and not that they got incredibly lucky 
First question is are you an international student 
If so I would worry about your visa status before the job thing If not then a good option might be to see if you can push back your start date with the company that s offered you a job to next year 
Be vague and don t offer any substantial info unless they ask 
I think you can apply for readmission in the fall also doesn t hurt to ask if you can intern with the company that gave you the job over summer 
I believe the team on the very left won the most amount of tosses and the cup indicates the team that won the ipl 
Bro Gambhir basically pulled us to WC final win along with Dhoni 
Parthiv Patel has actually been a solid opener I like their current order for the top 
When did this happen 
Who are you talking about 
No the issue was that OP is suggesting that someone is an Ass hat for parking the lime there while I agree that s not a designated spot for parking those scooters the person who parked it actually made an attempt to park it as close to the side as possible and that OP is just overreacting to something that probably posed issues to them 
I m assuming that the issue is that the lime is parked where it s not supposed to be 
If that s the case I m sure you could ve just moved it in the same time it took you to take a picture and post on reddit 
Don t know much about Klein but as far as course critique says he s yet to teach in a non abroad setting and even then his gpa is kinda low 
As for Doolittle his grading is quite fair but his test structure is a bit weird 
He places close to points in a test on a single tough question 
So if you screw up on that you re screwed also must say in certain topics he has a double or nothing rule with minimal partial credit 
Take it with Doolittle 
It s a hard class regardless of who you take it with and will require a lot of effort 
With Doolittle he has a bunch of online resources to help you out and those resources are open to the public so you can even get a head start for next semester 
I mean I pay tuition for the classes I m registered for 
If a professor keeps cancelling class for personal reasons multiple times throughout the semester then I would expect the professor to show up to those lectures and at least attempt to teach 
Worst case get his TA or a substitute to cover that class 
As for the Barton thing when was he picked up before being dropped 
There is a rule that the player has to be on another teams roster for at least hours before being eligible to hit the waivers 
Would you consider oladipo a keeper in a points league 
What are sim leagues 
Fire up you ZUBACSSSS wait 
I don t think the league should interfere with a coaching decision if a player has vocally stated that he does not want to be part of a teams future plans why should you not be able to give his minutes to a player who will indeed want to stay long term 
On another note if the NBA could penalize a team by taking away its picks why can t it penalize a player who publicly requests for a trade to certain teams before his contract is up by disqualifying a team from offering him a contract 
Well here s what happened We re in a keeper league and I traded for AD sending love just a day after his injury Ben Simmons klay for AD millsap and his worst player Then I traded AD and someone can t remember for harden days after AD got injured and later rumors popped up that he might be shut down the team that had AD wanted to win this season so I approached him with jrue boogie rondo and Ingram right around the time that they were doing well for Ad and his worst my team is gutted but I realistically had no chance of winning this season so I prepared for next season 
team points league 
team points league bro 
Hardens been carrying me while AD is out 
They could get lucky and get another kuzma 
Thank god you put the 
Boogie has exceeded my expectations thus far though the sample size of games is very small I m just excited to see what he does when he gets fully integrated into the lineup 
We have rules as to what the lowest value of a player can be based on the waivers and FA 
So normally in our league we usually do balanced trades where the for essentially means an upgrade over one player and a downgrade over the second player Also the lowest value a player can be is essentially the average of the day and season average of the best player in the waivers at the current time 
So essentially even if a player is scoring points a game that won t be his value 
the team receiving him can simply drop him and take another player for a higher value 
Maybe try to implement a rule like that when setting values for a trade 
I had to veto this as commish because people in my league suspected collusion but last year a trade that got through in a points league was Jrue holiday Aaron Gordon Drummond and Lou Williams For Dennis smith skal labissiere John Collins and Avery Bradley The dude trading Drummond and the rest just joined our league and he was good friends With the guy he was trading to 
I m in a team points keeper league and there is a possibility that this trade would ve been vetoed in my league We look at a bunch of factors when vetoing trades and one of them depends on quality of the players beyond this season 
Let s be honest Giannis is a top player in fantasy 
Simmons would ve probably gone in the second round in my league but the main issue here is Aldridge s uncertainty in value given his age and the fact that he s in the spurs system vs Donovan Mitchell s great upside 
With that said however the biggest decider in whether this trade would ve been vetoed is the playoff picture 
If the guy having Giannis is more or less eliminated from playoffs this trade would be vetoed if he s still fighting for a playoff position or has secured it this trade would ve gone through TLDR there are multiple factors that usually determines why people veto a certain trade

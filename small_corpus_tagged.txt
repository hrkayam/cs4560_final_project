[Delta-Zeta-Beta] It s sometimes sad for people like me who want to know the truth despite the fact that it may hurt our mental health quite a bit
[fleeeb] But he was putting it straight into the attic but had to help his soster carry her box down to the car so left it at the bottom of the ladder to the attic

[Lenithriel] First one that comes to mind is between my ex and me this past Halloween
[Lenithriel] Went to some haunted houses bought tickets online
[Lenithriel] There were houses total
[Lenithriel] We ended up going through just and then we had to leave unexpectedly so we went to get a refund for the two we did visit
[Lenithriel] They refunded me the correct amount but he insisted it was no matter how much proof I showed him
[Lenithriel] It was probably the most frustrating moment of that entire relationship
[Lenithriel] We fought for hours
[Lenithriel] It was so stupid
[Lenithriel] So glad its over
[Jetsam5] I generally prefer psychological but well done physical can be just as good
[Jetsam5] Annihilation had some truly disturbing body horror but honestly the more psychological parts off the movie did really do anything for me
[Jetsam5] At the end of the day I do really think we should draw a distinction since all horror is psychological
[jdcpg] Exactly
[jdcpg] That why I am not even trying
[plvstvcbvrds] Putting on mascara
[plvstvcbvrds] I don t know why it requires the mouth thing

[Katsuro42] Basically this for me
[Katsuro42] I just sort of never got round to killing myself and then my depression just sort of eased up and now I do want to anymore

[KrifPum-PumKrif] Both are effective for evoking emotional responses but gore makes me feel gross whereas psychological horror and horror makes me actually
[KrifPum-PumKrif] Either are fine films but if I want to be frightened I ll never pick a gore film takes me out of the tension
[casey12297] Remember its juat a movie

[Nambot] I had the Mega Drive version of that game
[Nambot] It was a basic side scrolling shooter like Contra but not as hard but after every stage you had to do a first person flying stage ducking around and under various hazards
[Nambot] Also for some reason you had to do a guess the pattern minigame in the levels
[anonymous_man842740] Spencer
[Aoki-Kyoku] Original with subtitles
[Aoki-Kyoku] In translated movies the voice does not really match the emotions the actor is conveying to me it sounds like they are in a recording studio reading off a page into the mic and not conveying the same tone that they would be if there were really acting out the scene in front of the camera
[Aoki-Kyoku] I just feel like I can not connect to the characters the same way it doesn t feel believable to me and therefore becomes more distracting than reading subtitles is

[Ultimateace43] I have to disagree
[Ultimateace43] It the suspense in dead space that caused me to only play it for minutes and then violently yeet my controller when shit popped out at me
[Ultimateace43] I never made it past minutes lol
[PeksyTiger] In matrix Neo and Trinity went to the roof when rescuing Morpheus
[PeksyTiger] They were suprised to find a helicopter there so it was not part of the plan
[PeksyTiger] What the plan
[FreeRangeThinker] A pile of gold
[Ze_Pig777] Could care less
[Ze_Pig777] The religions of Abraham belong in the last millennium
[tangerinescream] The one where the old couple want to buy new young bodies for themselves it s called The I Sing The Body Electric and The Walking Distance I like too
[tangerinescream] My favorites tend to be the sweet ones but in scary The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street for me is the most horrifying anxiety inducing one along with The Midnight I can not watch those two without writhing in anxiousness
[BluePickledOnion] Which old witch
[TastyBrainMeats] Oh good
[TastyBrainMeats] I have to find those to read thank you
[Leinks] I think we have become desensitized wheb it comes to gore and violence due to all those slasher horror pics and movie violence
[Leinks] So i find gore in horror pocs boring and cringey and adding no value to the experience
[Leinks] Basically a waste of time
[Leinks] So i prefer a good mind fuck over cringey buckets of fake blood
[unicorntaco3] Happy cake day
[unicorntaco3] Im really happy they accept it its just that I talk about the community and memes and stuff related to that topic
[LionsPride14] I invest at least half of that
[R4NK5] Buy bitcoin
[PresumedEagle10] I mean considering half the content on reddit right now comes from there I can respect it I also don t get why people hate it it is essentially almsot the EXACT SAME as reddit stupid retarded kids following dumb trends to be included but people on til tok are actually self aware about it
[ThatZach] I inverted the camera in Okami HD because it was being dumb
[patricoassassin] Revenge of the Sith
[patricoassassin] Their are so many times where the Anakin and the council made super dumb decisions and screwed everything up
[swamptheyard] If they deliver the message good enough in their video then I see nothing wrong with it reddit is one of the most interesting sites online and it will make for some great content
[deeafterall] Yes and no
[deeafterall] It does get better but you get used to it and sorta like it
[deeafterall] It will take hundred page detours giving you the background on an incedental character but as you read it you grow to not mind those detours and the rambling nature of the book
[deeafterall] There is a lot of interesting philosophical insights in those parts of the story
[deeafterall] One last observation Brothers Karamazov is not a good introduction to Russian literature unless you prefer the trial by fire type of introductions
[DatAsker] It a privilege to hear about him and I often remind myself that I am the people I lost and I carry pieces of them within me wherever I go
[DatAsker] All that to say that it sounds like he still affecting people through you and your love for him

[Neverthelilacqueen] You mean Chinese food IS mailed from China
[Neverthelilacqueen]
[Frilledmeg] I can try
[Frilledmeg] Let start by asking what do you feel are the components to a question'
[Frilledmeg] Mine are mostly selfish in reasoning
[Frilledmeg] I often prefer others speaking or learning things so I ask them about them
[Frilledmeg] The question that makes them talk about them the longest fewer moments I try to say something and end up sounding retarded
[Frilledmeg] Therefore I have less anxiety
[Frilledmeg] I mostly have anxiety because I stutter or convey my point in an awkward way at least what feels like it to me you know when people give you a weird stare and such
[Frilledmeg] Much of that
[Frilledmeg] Subjectivity implies that the true answer applies a lot to one own personal opinion no matter where it constructed from
[Frilledmeg] And is therefore a fairly volatile subject objectively and probability wise
[Frilledmeg] Most people accrue values over time due to many experiences over time so it fairly complicated
[Frilledmeg] A shotgun approach is also often called painting something with a wide brush or some variation thereof
[Frilledmeg] It a very general way of describing a category often containing many more intricacies
[Sparkylizard] I forget if it canon or not but it been said Mandalorians picked up on this and basically used buckshot shotguns to take out Jedi quick and easy
[Sparkylizard] They said how Jedi view deflecting lasers as target practice and showed off by doing it rather than coming into melee range to take out a blaster wielding opponent
[Sparkylizard] The shotgun ensured they could deflect the pellets back and there was too much to block at the same time
[Zuckerschneggle] The muscles
[giantegg175] commit arson
[PhantomSam2412] Yes
[MrsHDG] Damn my memory is that good
[Haerveu] That rough I sorry
[instagramisdumb] Ofcourse Avengers Infinity war
[PenultimateKetchup] I tried to listen to that song a while back when there was a thread on here asking for the scariest song you heard or something like that
[PenultimateKetchup] Even though I watched the movie I forgot what the song sounded like so I listened to the preview on Spotify
[PenultimateKetchup] Made it through a few seconds before I internally said Fuck this and closed the entire app
[IcePickMan] Whenever I at work
[dollyguts13] Back in my day you could go where ever you wanted I just had to be close enough to hear when my mom calls me and since she can yell pretty fuckin loud that meant we could go around the neighborhood
[dollyguts13] I feel like do to the whole stranger danger thing kids are growing up to restricted and thus arent learning enough independence
[dollyguts13] Ya know when i was a kid i go to the neighbors house down the street and play doctor with a girl
[dollyguts13] Those moments are important to a child development imo because I seen the guys who grew up without those moments and YIKES they do not know how to talk to girls and sometimes they dont even know how to humanize them
[dollyguts13] Your kid needs that level of independence that way they can learn to be adventurous and learn to take risks
[dollyguts13] I just saying we got a lot of alone people now a days and its probably cuz kids arent forced to go outside and socialize anymore like they use to
[dollyguts13] People blame tinder for dating when really they should blame all those video games they played instead of learning proper social skills
[dollyguts13] Your Diamond League player buddy but you stutter when you talk to women

[stepho7] they were in the middle of a group exercise and they all stopped and stared as we walked in
[stepho7] we all just started at each other for like seconds lol i felt bad though bc there were teachers i felt most awkward around them
[NayrSlayer] Oh yeah Chipotle Tabasco is great
[NayrSlayer] My local grocery stores do tend to carry it any more though

[GrammatonYHWH] It was the summer before my senior year when a girl in my class got in a car accident
[GrammatonYHWH] She was in her car speeding and driving recklessly when she lost control and wrapped her car around a tree
[GrammatonYHWH] She made it out with scratches but her boyfriend went into comma and eventually succumbed in late September
[GrammatonYHWH] He would went into his junior year after that summer
[GrammatonYHWH] Well girl stopped going to school for awhile
[GrammatonYHWH] Then came back heavily medicated
[GrammatonYHWH] Pretty standard psychological trauma stuff for an yo
[GrammatonYHWH] To understand the scandal you have to know about the last time a student died at my school
[GrammatonYHWH] A girl died crossing the road about years before I started there
[GrammatonYHWH] Got hit trying to catch a bus
[GrammatonYHWH] There was tons of media coverage
[GrammatonYHWH] It forced the city council to pay for a pedestrian crossing
[GrammatonYHWH] The school paid to have a section of the school landscaped into a memorial garden
[GrammatonYHWH] The girl was into poetry so they started an annual poetry contest in her name held in the memorial garden where they setup a few concentric rows of benches
[GrammatonYHWH] Big fucking deal
[GrammatonYHWH] Big fucking news
[GrammatonYHWH] The scandal started when rumor went around that her dad was paying big money to the school and the media for this whole thing to disappear
[GrammatonYHWH] He is a pretty wealthy businessman and looking up his last name brings up news about him
[GrammatonYHWH] He did want the media to catch wind that his daughter killed a yo boy in her car
[GrammatonYHWH] That was over years ago
[GrammatonYHWH] The only tribute the school paid to that boy was the minute school assembly on the day of his death where they sent us all home
[GrammatonYHWH] I still fucking disgusted by it
[GrammatonYHWH] They reached out to me several times over the years asking me to join the alumni fund begging for money
[GrammatonYHWH] Every time I told them that I only donate if they setup some memorial for that boy
[EnvyTheStars] i enjoy the office
[EnvyTheStars] but parks and rec is way funnier
[EnvyTheStars] this is really controversial for me to say apparently

[hitoned] There a lot of reasons I not but one includes a recent event when my wifes cousin was murdered
[hitoned] She was crying in her car and the radio started fuzzing out which was weird as that station was headquartered a couple miles away and tended to only go out about an hour north or south
[hitoned] It began playing a old out of genre song she used to sing with him and it played twice in a row
[hitoned] She called the radio station to ask wtf and they said they did play it once
[hitoned] She recorded it but after showing it to me the file corrupted
[hitoned] No one else will ever believe that but I do really give a fuck

[Dnewkirk87] I think he s a repulsive human
[Maryjaneplante] I sell herb so it chill
[white-chat-pelle] It is actually partly my own take on the matter the real world is another Matrix not run by machines but by humans that has its own set of rules and as Neo understands the rules There is no spoon he can use them at his advantage
[white-chat-pelle] The reason why he can blow up machines in the movie is because he knows how they work and can use his Matrix cheat codes irl he knows he is the One and they ca hurt him he has to meet the Architect and rebuild Sion discover that it is another form of control and choose a different path for himself and humans
[white-chat-pelle] In movie he is not as powerful and has to go over them he sees the bigger picture
[a_normal_joe] Stressed out by pilots just made me think of how I m no longer a kid o have to grow up life Is different know and no matter how much I want to go back to past with all my old friends old memories I can t I can t I can t I just can t I can t turn back time to the good old days
[ImpracticallySharp] For me Prometheus did the opposite
[ImpracticallySharp] The Space Jockey was a wonderful unfathomable mystery in Alien and then in Prometheus it was revealed to just be an angry buff blue guy
[ImpracticallySharp] I do consider it canon for the Alien movies just because it took the mystery out of it and replaced it with prosaic disappointment
[Dadwithissues] Good read thanks lmao

[Actual-Scarcity] It is subjective but it is complex
[Actual-Scarcity] Depending on what you measure the US either looks like a world leader or a failed state
[Actual-Scarcity] The point is that the constitution on its own has failed to secure for the American people a quality of life befitting a modern industrialized nation
[Actual-Scarcity] It has required many amendments and hundreds of years of organized struggle in order to fulfill its most basic tenets
[Actual-Scarcity] Greatest governing document ever written is a strong statement
[Actual-Scarcity] While it is historically very significant generally that is the expert consensus
[Actual-Scarcity] You obviously know better than they do though
[turtelteller] oi fuck off
[SifMeisterWoof] Karma much
[thee_awkwardseal] i prefer a good psychological horror game where you can melt the bastard with a gun
[thee_awkwardseal] so I say both
[MoisturizeMeJon] My psvita
[BiggestForts] Nothing I just respect them unless it obvious that they disrespectful
[thecerebralassassinn] Blood gore and shit like just a good old slasher flick
[thecerebralassassinn] I love watching films like Wrong Turn Saw Final destination even though it s technically not a horror film more like thriller mainly because I know it s fake and I can laugh about how overly dramatic the deaths are
[thecerebralassassinn] However psychological horror is good on occasion whenever it s done well like insidious or annabelle if they are classed as psychological horror
[Snowden42] YES
[Snowden42] It could have been amazing
[Snowden42] Start the movie with the woman waking up and tell the story from her perspective
[Snowden42] She slowly starts to discover that she was woken up intentionally as the movie shifts from a romance into a suspense movie trying to get away from herself
[Snowden42] If could have been incredible
[TastyBrainMeats] I thinking more in terms of general maritime law on top of that
[Corpuscular_Crumpet] Megacolons are waaaaaa aaaay better
[caligaris_cabinet] Plan from Outer Space
[BATM4NN] Gone Girl scared me more than any horror movie ever could

[ShinyRhubarb] My absolute pleasure to spread the word of the glorious
[doorang] Read someones top poops in another thread
[doorang] Came to the conclusion that most pepole would have a couple of good poops thats really memorable
[doorang] So go ahead and share
[doorang] Ctrl v my own Ooohhh pooping in the wild always gives oppertunity to find a nice view
[doorang] Even thought no one asked heres my top three
[doorang] At in the morning looking out over a lake where a swan couple had started thier nestbuilding
[doorang] The whole lake were still coverd in fog that slowly lifted as I was getting ready to leave
[doorang]
[doorang] evil hill a hill close to our base in Mali
[doorang] That hill was always subject to have people watching it as it was the only logical place for someone to lead indirekt fire on to us
[doorang] Left a real sense of accomplishment leaving a huge steaming pile in a insurgents would be fire cover
[doorang] The view was desert as far as the eye could see
[doorang]
[doorang] A sloop overlooking a abandond farm slowly rotting away complete with stables outhouse and a little bridge crossing
[doorang] Truly surreal when you realise your the first person there for about years
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] Nope I pointing out a failure in your character for accusing another of not thinking critically while making several reasoning mistakes
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] by saying radical liberals scare me
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] where did i accuse someone of not thinking critically
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] here an example of attempting to undermine someone character rather than attacking their argument ad hominem But the rest of your post is horseshit as I think even you agree if you did rational thinking
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] Knowing the name of a logical fallacy does make you logical and applying it incorrectly REALLY does help your case
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] how have i applied it incorrectly
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] The sick part is I knew you pull the at least mention something bad about him rhetorical trick hoping I mention something you can bog down in a quagmire of changed subjects and gish gallops so I preemptively linked you to the list
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] And you tried it anyway
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] we exchanged maybe comments and you know exactly how i respond to a specific issue you have with Trump
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] it becoming quite clear that you have absolutely no intention of finding middle ground so what is your intent here
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] I ca be sure how much of your failure to engage is dishonesty and how much of it is stupidity but it certainly beneath me to talk to you further
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] i have tried nothing BUT to engage you lol i asked you for specifics so we can confirm your bold claims which you refuse to do and i continue responding despite your disrespectful and patronizing attitude
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] i think you fit in the category of liberal' because there seems to be no talking to you
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] we have talked about one specific thing you hate about Trump you simply refuse and assume i going to' you down whatever that means
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] i called out your disrespectful behavior and you doubled down as if how you behaving is justified
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] i mean there some things i do like about Trump we may agree on something but you have no interest in finding common ground lol so again what is your intent
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] you are the poster child of someone that has not been held accountable for their words and actions
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] you do take responsibility for the way you talk to someone who you has an opinion that you probably agree with
[Am_i_the_ash_hole] i wish you the best
[underlicou] I have a fetish with girls dressed as a playboy bunny it not so bad but we were at an Easter party it was bad at the time
[I_love_myself_not] It looks in color but no it doesn t taste weird

[learningstages] Everything before that actually happened tho
[carrigandr] Proof right here https Also because you brainiacs started eating his shit when he ran for president not just when he went down in history as the worst one
[miquelle44] Very clever
[Particular_Radish] Thank you for your contribution
[Particular_Radish] I too am autistic and hate the Your autistic so you are stupid and dumb and retarded argument if it even is one
[Intelligent_Delay] If a scientific idea is true then it is considered scientific law Not true
[Intelligent_Delay] Laws get redefined all the time
[Intelligent_Delay] Even the law of gravitation has been modified to fit our ever increasing understanding of the universe
[Intelligent_Delay] Nothing in science is fact and anyone who regards things that way is not a real scientist
[Caedma] Uff
[Caedma] That sounds stressful
[Caedma] Hang in there
[Ithinknotthot] Psychological horror Heavy Rain is a very good example of a psychological horror game and Outlast uses a mix of both at the same time
[Tabathaa] sooo funny
[Tabathaa] well worth the votes for the entertainment value
[battychefcunt] It s shit isn t it
[battychefcunt] Overrated bollocks
[GotMyOrangeCrush] Cademe hdferere to sayffhfe thicfrfgis
[herndonsjcad] The more I learned in school like the atrocities that happened I could help but wonder how could god let this happen
[herndonsjcad] And If god is all knowing then what is the point of being tested in life since he already knows what is going to happen
[herndonsjcad] I begged for a sign that he was real and nothing
[Satinsbestfriend] Itsaperfect example of a physical psychological horror movie which is hard to so right
[WizardsOf12] I was born out of wedlock
[WizardsOf12] In terms of stability it is not ideal but things happen all too soon
[Agarwal_Aryan] For me the idea that we are alone in the universe is more terrifying
[Agarwal_Aryan] I mean we will all probably live and die in this world so being alone is not going to matter as much but if we are alone and then there is a possibility that someone could attack us from outer space is scarier than anything
[ZaMiLoD] I watched babadook and inside out yes the Pixar movie the same day
[ZaMiLoD] After having watched inside out the grief metaphors in babadook was clear as day and it felt like it was almost two movies about the same issue
[jkuhn01] How to tell if you adopted
[daddy_clean] Nice
[daddy_clean] I definitely one of the people who focuses on trying to get faster at the puzzle
[daddy_clean] I average with full CFOP
[Alexx_but_reddit] How so
[unicorntaco3] I totally agree with you
[unicorntaco3] Its just that learning about the community history or just stories I read online makes me want to talk about the things I am learning and share it with them
[unicorntaco3] Its not explicitly about my sexuality but the community as a whole
[hellisnow666] Dwight
[ac19723] Our first two were out of wedlock
[ac19723] Our third was after we were married
[ac19723] One day playing video games with third he was kicking my ass I commented oh you little bastard he replied no that the other two
[-Sansha-] https you right
[Medicalhuman] id give you n award if i had money
[SniperPanda4780] Imma take that as a no fair enough
[Big_Oreos] I get turned away from gorey horror films
[Big_Oreos] They get boring to watch and I feel like the gore is corny and compensating
[Big_Oreos] I like the horror films with the slow build ups like a group of friends entering a etc
[Caljack13] It s perfectly acceptable
[piemel83] Most of it yes but depending on the sediment I sure they also find entire plastic bottles
[kkf6] Your welcome
[YetAnotherNontroll] With a side of chianti
[Caesar_Sosay] This theory has been debunked
[Caesar_Sosay] To shoot President Kennedy Hickey would have had to stand up or raise his gun to at least the level of his head in order to get past shooting the two people in front of him as well as the cars windscreen that had both visors raised
[Caesar_Sosay] A man named Charles Bronson captured video footage that shows Hickey does do either of these things during the shots which subsequently corroborates Hickey account of events
[CilantroMarshmallows] Word we can be friends again
[Random-dude007] Psychological horror
[Random-dude007] At start or at short age you get scared of physical horror cause your imagination is much better than now and you get nightmares as adults your imagination capability decreases meaning less dreams so i will go with psychological horror
[deleteandrewind] It perfectly fine
[FijiWater001] But it happened of camera
[FijiWater001] There no proof that such interaction too place
[chexwithoutthemix] agreed
[cdooley3] Because I trying to get laid
[DrivenByPettiness] Oh that also happened at mine
[DrivenByPettiness] But we only had some on the first floor and being on the third floor almost all senior year and having to run down there and back up in minutes really made you become speed
[Thedragonhat77] Ppl who watch stupid tv shows
[Le04in] Everybody bout to say phsychological
[SirShmooey] The Expanse has a pretty gnarly opening minutes
[mushikyto] I think it really depends on perspective
[mushikyto] Usually physical horror is not that terrifying I would say it is disturbing
[mushikyto] But if you experience that shit in IRL it would leave scars for the rest of the life
[mushikyto] For example soldiers who fought in war they usually experience PTSD because of physical horror they had seen
[mushikyto] The same applies for usual people if you put them to same environment even if it is artificial
[mushikyto] Lets say VR games
[mushikyto] But for me personally psychological horror is more terrifying because it makes my brain crazy and I keep seeing stuff in every corner mirror and etc
[ACanadianOwl] The Harry Potter movies were well before TV series actually had budgets or Netflix was a thing and HBO added plot to their porn
[ACanadianOwl] They did well for what they had to do and they absolutely nailed the actors and actresses
[ACanadianOwl] It rare to have movies where the talent grows literally and figuratively with the time line
[abbabil] Almost every horror movie
[gamesdas] Happened to me once working at Thales Singapore
[gamesdas] I was given to troubleshoot a piece of code
[gamesdas] Instead I rewrote the entire code and it did work at all
[gamesdas] But one of my peers helped to correct that for me without the Project Lead finding it
[gamesdas] I learnt a valuable lesson that day listen to the problem before solving it
[gamesdas] I had a great time with the company nevertheless
[FoxtrotSierraTango] Im not sure if this is what OP is talking about but there that observation that in Raiders of the Lost Ark Indiana Jones is almost completely irrelevant to the story
[FoxtrotSierraTango] The Big Bang Theory did a pretty good bit on it https
[Zuckerschneggle] In the gutter
[AUfan36] Thanks
[AUfan36] I have dealt with women trying to start shit with me to get me to go off on them and almost get fired
[tiny3rror] those Alien fans who draw Xenomorph porn or the AvP fans who draw porn and say that Xenomorphs are smarter in the AvP lol also those obsessed kids who ship Carl and Rick or say that Lizzie was right ugh I was okay with Lizzie liking walkers before she tried to strangle Judith and killed her sisters few series later
[notthatanxious] I would love to be loved and not be paid for it
[notthatanxious] Go on make that happen'
[opossum703] Just pretending
[AlreadyAligned] Lotr
[21OwlCities] The one about my triple dick friend
[MarshallUberSwagga] do you have any recommendations on this
[Caesar_Sosay] This theory has been debunked
[Caesar_Sosay] To shoot President Kennedy Hickey would have had to stand up or raise his gun to at least the level of his head in order to get past shooting the two people in front of him as well as the cars windscreen that had both visors raised
[Caesar_Sosay] A man named Charles Bronson captured video footage that shows Hickey does do either of these things during the shots which subsequently corroborates Hickey account of events

[yourstruly19] They gave her a small electric shock
[--_-Deadpool-_--] One of my favorites is Kind
[Kidminder] I laughed too hard at this
[MrsHDG] Tell anyone I can that will help get some professionals involved because too many people in my life have committed suicide

[TheWaddlingSeal] Is there an amount of illegal immigrants that live up to OP suspicions
[TheWaddlingSeal] Most likely
[TheWaddlingSeal] Does that give them the right to generalize an entire population based on their prejudices
[TheWaddlingSeal] Absolutely not
[TheWaddlingSeal] No one can judge a group of people on the actions of a few assuming those actions are even true and to think such a thing really is ridiculous

[10GuyIsDrunk] I am completely unphased by basically all physical horror
[10GuyIsDrunk] I do even know if it a matter of desensitization for me I do not recall ever being put off by in films even as a very young child
[10GuyIsDrunk] In real life I incredibly and staunchly pacifistic and hate violence of all kinds but in art it has little to no effect on me
[10GuyIsDrunk] Psychological horror however I experience on a deep and terrifying vivid level
[10GuyIsDrunk] I traumatized myself in my youth watching these kinds of horror films and then avoided watching them for most of my teens and only got back into watching horror films as an adult
[10GuyIsDrunk] I enjoy horror films of all kinds but I watch physical horror films like background blanket type shit
[10GuyIsDrunk] I always down for some shitty but because it like a white noise machine it has no impact and I could care less about missing scenes while doing other stuff
[10GuyIsDrunk] With psychological horror though I actually watching no playing games or reading reddit that the good stuff so I have to give it my attention and bundle up on the couch
[10GuyIsDrunk] And then I regret watching later when I in the shower or wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble sleeping again
[10GuyIsDrunk] But I love that shit

[PutItOnMyDesk] I think as long as both parents stick around and work together to be in the child life and support him or her it not inherently bad
[PutItOnMyDesk] There have been plenty of kind emotionally stable productive members of society born out of wedlock

[kyl_mag04] Forgive me if I m wrong but maybe it s about culture
[kyl_mag04] You have your own culture and you should celebrate it and other peoples culture but you can t take someone else culture and make it your own especially when it changes it entirely and people get hurt
[Freezing_Wolf] Generally psychological but I can appreciate some gore from time to time

[BigBolegde] Pretty sure doing either one of those physical things should at the very least induce a mental breakdown in any normal person if they survive of course
[BigBolegde] In my opinion the psychological side of gore and pain is the most underdeveloped thing in movies characters suffer an injury that would cripple them for life and tend to just walk it off and only scream a little bit louder

[EatThatPusi445] A spectre is haunting Europe the spectre of communism
[EatThatPusi445] All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre Pope and Tsar Metternich and Guizot French Radicals and German
[EatThatPusi445] Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power
[EatThatPusi445] Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism against the more advanced opposition parties as well as against its reactionary adversaries
[EatThatPusi445] Two things result from this fact I
[EatThatPusi445] Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power
[EatThatPusi445] II
[EatThatPusi445] It is high time that Communists should openly in the face of the whole world publish their views their aims their tendencies and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself
[EatThatPusi445] To this end Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto to be published in the English French German Italian Flemish and Danish languages
[EatThatPusi445] Chapter Bourgeois and Proletarians German Original The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles
[EatThatPusi445] Freeman and slave patrician and plebeian lord and serf and journeyman in a word oppressor and oppressed stood in constant opposition to one another carried on an uninterrupted now hidden now open fight a fight that each time ended either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes
[EatThatPusi445] In the earlier epochs of history we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders a manifold gradation of social rank
[EatThatPusi445] In ancient Rome we have patricians knights plebeians slaves in the Middle Ages feudal lords vassals journeymen apprentices serfs in almost all of these classes again subordinate gradations
[EatThatPusi445] The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms
[EatThatPusi445] It has but established new classes new conditions of oppression new forms of struggle in place of the old ones
[EatThatPusi445] Our epoch the epoch of the bourgeoisie possesses however this distinct feature it has simplified class antagonisms
[EatThatPusi445] Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps into two great classes directly facing each other Bourgeoisie and Proletariat
[EatThatPusi445] From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns
[EatThatPusi445] From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed
[EatThatPusi445] The discovery of America the rounding of the Cape opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie
[EatThatPusi445] The and Chinese markets the colonisation of America trade with the colonies the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally gave to commerce to navigation to industry an impulse never before known and thereby to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society a rapid development
[EatThatPusi445] The feudal system of industry in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets
[EatThatPusi445] The manufacturing system took its place
[EatThatPusi445] The were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop
[EatThatPusi445] Meantime the markets kept ever growing the demand ever rising
[EatThatPusi445] Even manufacturer no longer sufficed
[EatThatPusi445] Thereupon steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production
[EatThatPusi445] The place of manufacture was taken by the giant Modern Industry the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires the leaders of the whole industrial armies the modern bourgeois
[EatThatPusi445] Modern industry has established the world market for which the discovery of America paved the way
[EatThatPusi445] This market has given an immense development to commerce to navigation to communication by land
[EatThatPusi445] This development has in its turn reacted on the extension of industry and in proportion as industry commerce navigation railways extended in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed increased its capital and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages
[EatThatPusi445] We see therefore how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange
[EatThatPusi445] Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class
[EatThatPusi445] An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility an armed and association in the medieval commune here independent urban republic as in Italy and Germany there taxable third estate of the monarchy as in France afterwards in the period of manufacturing proper serving either the or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility and in fact cornerstone of the great monarchies in general the bourgeoisie has at last since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market conquered for itself in the modern representative State exclusive political sway
[EatThatPusi445] The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie
[EatThatPusi445] The bourgeoisie historically has played a most revolutionary part
[EatThatPusi445] The bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
[EatThatPusi445] It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his natural superiors and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked than callous cash payment
[EatThatPusi445] It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
[EatThatPusi445] It has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom Free Trade
[EatThatPusi445] In one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploitation
[EatThatPusi445] The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe
[EatThatPusi445] It has converted the physician the lawyer the priest the poet the man of science into its paid wage labourers
[EatThatPusi445] The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation
[EatThatPusi445] The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages which reactionaries so much admire found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence
[EatThatPusi445] It has been the first to show what man s activity can bring about
[EatThatPusi445] It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids Roman aqueducts and Gothic cathedrals it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades
[EatThatPusi445] The bourgeoisie can not exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production and thereby the relations of production and with them the whole relations of society
[EatThatPusi445] Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form was on the contrary the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes
[EatThatPusi445] Constant revolutionising of production uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
[EatThatPusi445] All fixed relations with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions are swept away all ones become antiquated before they can ossify
[EatThatPusi445] All that is solid melts into air all that is holy is profaned and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind
[EatThatPusi445] The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe
[EatThatPusi445] It must nestle everywhere settle everywhere establish connexions everywhere
[EatThatPusi445] The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country
[EatThatPusi445] To the great chagrin of Reactionists it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood
[EatThatPusi445] All national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed
[EatThatPusi445] They are dislodged by new industries whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
[EatThatPusi445] In place of the old wants satisfied by the production of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
[EatThatPusi445] In place of the old loca trimmed due to comment size limit

[Eulogetos] Gon na be a lot of stories
[Eulogetos] I ca listen to any of the music I made when I was younger because my girlfriend at the time helped me compose most of it
[Eulogetos] She was a very talented with a knack for music and whenever I see a snippet of an old project on my computer and listen to it I can remember the exact moment she played the melody for the first time vividly
[Eulogetos] It definitely hurt my confidence as a composer when I realized that she basically wrote half of my entire catalog
[Eulogetos] Been trying to get back into it but it hard to shake the memories associated with it
[Eulogetos] I gave a lot of our rough sheet music to her parents when she passed and know I should write it down again for posterity but I ca even think about it

Get the other job first then decide 
Ah my bad 
We responsible because despite overwhelming odds in our favor tree whose fruit we should not eat all the trees in Eden we chose the one 
Sin carries on to become more sin 
There are kids who are born defective because their mothers took drugs in pregnancy 
Is that God fault or the mother 
I do have enough room to go too deeply into cancer but it fundamentally a similar idea 
Massive genetic mutations due to generations of sin under increasingly worsening environmental conditions makes cancer far more likely 
It like saying someone is more likely to develop lung cancer after spending their entire lives in the most polluted city in the world 
Correction bullet generally refers to one minute 
Three minutes is still considered blitz 
My family is from the south relative to Shanghai 
We become expats for all the reasons above 
And yes most Chinese do 
The more North you go the more brainwashed people are but you be hard pressed to find a Chinese family who did talk negatively about the government in the privacy of their homes at dinner 
The younger generation is more naive definitely 
But there a reason most people sent their kids abroad if possible 
It just that they do trust American propaganda either 
But the certainly do trust China 
Although I should be clear most distrust the government but there is still nationalistic pride 
Just like how you might be proud to be an American for all the constitutional values they might be proud to be Chinese for the history and culture 
It a very pragmatic system 
As one friend says yeah it just national interests so of course the US would do this and China in response in response to the Uyghurs and HK 
They are not nearly as ideal driven as Americans are 
Sure that sounds good 
Is this soon like this month or this season roughly guessing 
Also if I install it now can it be retroactively updated 
I see 
Thank you so much for the answer 
I very excited haha 
They have bigger class sizes and a lot of the classes are mandatory so comparing people who signed up for a hard class who wanted it people who just want to get through the You can probably see why the professors would be more paranoid 
I hope OP gets this properly resolved cause this really sucks 
My professor not being as unfair but I on the short end of the curve in my final class at GT cause basically the entire class cheated on the last exam 
Avg was like points higher which is unreasonable even for the extra hour and open notes 
All the legit students are just getting shat on and the administration does give two shits 
I work in the field of AI and engineering so perhaps I can shine some light on this matter 
First China has large amounts of data 
When it comes to classification and de facto implementation of already created technology they can do so at scale 
However this is often at the cost of liberties and often are thinly veiled government monitoring and surveillance 
Second and this is likely the most important part China will likely not catch up to American companies in computing power 
The government is subsidizing Baidu and Alibaba cloud computer to the tune of billions of dollars but the hardware and code is simply not up to par with the likes of Amazon Microsoft Google Oracle Cisco Facebook and the like 
Third many Chinese students come to America to pursue CS degrees and end up staying due to high salaries in the US 
Many Chinese engineers leave China for the same reason 
The only reason many Chinese engineers stay in China is for language familiarity and family 
However many ultimately still make the decision to leave because China is an alluring for skilled engineers 
The government and the private sector is consistently underpaid the work culture is famously which means to days a week 
The corporate culture on top is often blatantly sexist abusive and all the rest of it 
In America you may have some accusations of sexism and some minor controversies but you at least have high pay and social prestige 
In China it merely a stable job with decent pay and outside of Baidu Alibaba and one or two other companies there not good work to be found 
There are more reasons than these but China will only overtake the US in AI applications and that may not even be a good thing 
Chinese ability to properly use AI for influential projects and innovative pursuits is lacking 
Most of their technology is still squandered on controlling the populace rather than making original advances in consumer technology 
And let me be clear the Chinese advances are merely copying American innovations 
If America stopped innovating you see a sharp decrease in Chinese AI advancement 
No the logical next step is not to move to China 
Speaking as a Chinese person you should understand that in China the government can literally take anything you own at any time 
You know the old phrase wealth is fleeting 
Yeah that is quite literally the case in China 
There is little freedom in being rich and powerful unless you want to be an expat 
Companies may move to China temporarily for cheap labor but as automation grows in complexity and underscores manufacturing China overwhelming population will actually serve as a detriment 
In comparison companies can shift out of China the cheaper automation and skilled labor is back home like in the US 
Many companies are already shifting out of China and India due to more skilled engineers and innovative engineering culture back in the US Having so many mouths to feed and every mouth loving expensive meats like pork and crab and shrimp is not sustainable 
The Chinese people only put up with their government because they are fed and growing richer 
The moment that stops being the case China will destabilize 
Many outsiders who hold your view often do seem to understand how much Chinese people fundamentally distrust the government 
I know Americans like to complain and dislike their government too but at least you are constantly in fear of the government to the degree we are 
The amount of corruption you have is laughable in comparison frankly 
Eminent domain can at least be challenged in court and it does cover literally everything you can possibly own 
Undertale 
I played all kinds of games my entire life but none have ever made me feel such strange and strong emotions continuously 
People are blatantly cheating and fucked the curve for me 
Now I have to risk the B because I scored a few points lower than the cheaters despite being above class average for the whole semester 
I fucking livid 
Vocational and technical training 
So many people would benefit from it 
Just look at Germany 
Because huge companies have a fiduciary responsibility to stockholders 
Real estate is a difficult market to manage and property taxes is a liability for a company in that market 
In this case if I own Amazon stock I do want them to go into the estate market because it a terrible investment for a company 
If I wanted to invest in RE I just do it myself 
They a huge and successful company largely in terms of stock prices 
The stock market values more than real estate because there what makes money 
Real estate is hard to be profitable in most cases 
America land on the other hand is pretty worthless 
Compared to handling of the world internet traffic to handling of it farming capability but honestly it mostly just empty roads I much rather take the former 
It just so much more profitable 
At this rate I gon na leave the Discord and ignore the game just for this ad spamming 
A post every season about substantial progress is fine but nobody is gon na volunteer their skills or apply for a position from a bot spamming on a fucking anime subreddit 
tldr It worked in Alaska and it work for the rest of the country Price inelastic markets 
real estate would not be affected by a universal income 
The rapid flow of money would increase the aggregate expenditure 
This marks an increase in the average consumer ability to purchase goods while accounting for inflation 
Here is an excellent resource by UPenn Wharton on Alaska who implemented a similar UBI program https Essentially People will still work Inflation has not been a concern in Alaska since UBI came into effect http 
VAT is not the reason companies would move overseas 
And even those companies that do most and even some stores of manufacturing end up returning to the US due to a much more skilled labor force 
My family runs four different manufacturing businesses and the business that was tenable in China and India the past decade is increasingly undoable 
China is no longer a good place to open factories India has extreme supply chain issues and SEA is simply too underdeveloped to have goods manufactured 
Any other country in the world either lacks the infrastructure the trade agreements or simply is too expensive 
VAT would hurt businesses like us nor any of the businesses see a net loss that could already afford it 
It practically only hurts the largest businesses that is not paying enough taxes anyway 
When did he ever support UBI 
Said by someone who read it but did understand it 
The fun thing is I do have a social life 
But that means I make time for it 
I do let it consume all my time 
Not to mention the whole point of working with friends occasionally is to help with my mental health and network organically 
However more often than not I see people have much social life to the point it weighs on their grades internships and more 
The key thing to realize is that school work comes in waves 
At the peak of those waves a lot of people stress out and do buckle down 
They go for behavior when they should be working 
People do need others to tell them to work so hours is naturally going to be a lower limit only when needed 
After all when you done with work who says to themselves Oh I have nothing to do but I still have hours on my quota 
Ca hang out now 
I definitely not a genius 
I definitely struggled 
I and many other people only achieve through collaboration and teamwork 
I have no support network 
I a first generation student 
I alone at college because all of my cs friends went to other universities in other states 
All I did was befriend people in my classes and we worked together 
Studied together ate together and worked hard late into the night 
Stanford is hard I sure 
I go to a school of similar caliber 
Hell we pretty much rip off your master classes 
But these struggles have been overcome before not with test banks or cheating with large sums of money 
It just work 
Find friends 
Work 
That all 
If you still failing find out what you doing inefficiently 
Do go partying 
Do go drinking 
Just work 
I seen people who could succeed waste themselves by needing to relax spend one or two nights a week partying and goofing off 
Work 
hours a day if you have to 
That all there is 
I went from no network job or technical ability to a great job and opportunities as well as academic record 
If you struggling work harder 
If you working hard already work smarter 
Learn how to learn 
Learn how to focus 
If you stressed learn why and compensate 
It hard that why we paid so much 
That why schools like Stanford are famous 
If you work hard and smart enough you naturally find free time after a while 
Because they peaked 
I hauled ass in high school 
I respect the time I spent but they not the best 
Yeah 
Is that the whole point of a tax 
Oh no corporations are doing what we incentivized them to do 
I see 
I sorry to hear that 
I would get those issues dealt with first honestly 
It only get harder as the classes get harder 
What stopping you 
Too much noise 
Unable to sit down for long periods of time 
You know what it is 
Youth voters do live in the early states 
Most young people live in cities 
New York Washington Mass Illinois etc 
are all not early states 
The average age of Iowa Vermont GA etc 
are old 
That just it 
I young 
I vote 
By the time I actually can vote my candidate s have already dropped out 
This is true for later classes but your first CS classes are still pretty damn fundamental 
If he failing all of them then he needs to take a hard look at his study habits his understanding of OOP and data structures and actually buckle down and learn 
It was tough for me too 
I did make any excuses of how hard it was 
I knew I had to know it for interviews and I dedicated a lot of time for it 
Yeah this exactly 
I do care how naturally smart you are 
If you ca apply it to anything or put in the work you worse than a naturally stupid person 
You won the lottery and squandered it that all 
I gotten less work actually 
There have been some assignments made optional and it been helpful 
But that being said having to take an exam and upload it on a terrible Internet connection makes me extremely nervous 
I have one on Thursday and if I ca upload it or email them in time I beyond screwed 
If he is it good reinforcement 
If he is then the push will light his ass on fire 
Lol I thought OP was talking about weight gain from sitting all day writing code 
I ca downvote here lol 
The game is literally scheduled to be released in and is like complete 
My phone broke down and it being repaired right now 
I still have to scan my test next week and I have no idea if the logistics will work out in time for this hard ass final class final exam 
Yeah my warranty expires in July and I been waiting on over a month for their damn repair box to show up 
They were supposed to send me a box and cover the charging port damage under warranty but since they were delayed I ended up dropping my phone and screen cracked 
Now they ca do a partial repair and have to charge me for a screen repair 
It not even optional if I want to get the charging port fixed 
Absolutely ridiculous 
It not selling out 
He just endorsed the Democratic nominee 
I love Bernie but he lost 
That just it 
I saying this as a guy who literally wrote in Bernie in 
Stop it with the nonsense 
Hahaha I love it 
Cheers 
A lot of truckers and people out in the Midland listen to podcasts 
Many engineers and work from home people will also listen 
Commuters etc 
It our job to share this podcast and make it popular to the point of even JRE 
In those days the mob who would walk miles away from their work and jeer at a prophet were the same people who would kill 
If you were a regular citizen of the country you be farming or otherwise involved in work embroidery metallurgy etc 
These tasks took up all of your day 
There was much time for rest much less walking far from your post to be an asshole to a prophet 
These men supported the death of the prophet and made fun of his disciple in a time of mourning 
Even barring regular behavior to jeer at anyone during mourning is morally and culturally repugnant then and now 
I sure you just continue to wave our explanations as speculation but at least now you have no excuse 
If you do choose to understand context then that on you 
Keep up the good work 
Youjo Senki movie got close to talking about communism 
Do have enough time to read the article right now can someone give me a tldr as to much they are detecting to determine the text and its validity 
Is that still required 
That unfortunate lol 
Being required to eat at Woodies was one of the worst parts of my freshman year 
WV was definitely an improvement but I feel like I did eat enough for the per diem price to be worth it 
It was cheaper even just paying out of pocket per meal 
lived primarily on West and North Ave 
In my experience North Ave is not quiet as West but it certainly not nearly as loud as East 
If you live high enough on NA it pretty peaceful 
This is of course barring the occasional truck but you can hear that from West sometimes too 
The bus for groceries was really hard for me to catch when I was a freshman and it was really that much closer to the than North Ave 
The CRC being close was definitely good though 
When I lived there we had fire alarms every other the heater is very difficult to turn and there was a consistent problem of flying ants 
Perhaps parachuting ants 
If you know basic cooking aka order large box of pasta and go to the grocery regularly meal plans can be overpriced 
It depends on how often you eat 
If you eat less than calories a day there are cheaper and more effective options in my opinion 
West is far from Tech Square but one bus ride away which has Publix 
If you plan on cooking East or North Ave is best 
But if you also like quiet North Ave is likely the best 
It has a Publix grocery three blocks away 
Do not live in Woodruff 
Neither one 
As far as general freshman things your first two years will be relatively easy but you spend a lot of time in classes labs and assignments 
Your last two years will be hard as hell content wise but you will have only a few large and hard assignments 
Of course there are exceptions 
The brightest and best places to work on campus are the Crosland building aka new library CULC the new Environmental building among others 
Bring as little as possible 
If you want good internet for gaming Ethernet is very good 
What major are you 
People living spots can vary depending on their closest buildings 
If you a business major do live on West because Scheller is far on East for example 
It also usually written in an English title with in Hindi at the very end when YouTube usually cuts off titles 
Why would you need a reset button 
Just refresh the page 

If the intentionally simplified three word motto is misunderstood by the general public then they should have picked a better motto 
These words are misunderstood because they are intentionally inflammatory and overly broad 
No I do believe all women 
I do believe all men 
I have empathy for them 
If someone came to me and said she was raped I believe her because we would already have a deep relationship for her to be able to confide in me 
But if some random woman comes and tells the media how would I be able to make an informed decision 
Sure you can show that statistically is false and is not but that not the point 
The courts are built with the intent that no innocent person should be convicted not that all criminals ought to be locked up 
I do have enough information to condemn so I will not 
It a sad reality but that just how it is 
Yes I agree with that 
But I think there two things here One it does have to be a pamphlet 
There are plenty of garbage disguised as books that are circulating 
Two what is the merit of being an amazing writer with all the fjnesse and organization of Shakespeare 
It important to communicate but I argue for the majority of people writing skill does need to be inspired by Hamlet or the Odyssey 
That why there technical communication and everyday vernacular 
What if that person mind is not particularly interesting 
I find the majority of books today to be a massive waste of time similar to a clickbait article 
That wonderful 
However why is it that it such a popular sign of intellectual pursuit 
There such a wide variety of written content that simply saying reading is good or any number of variants seems about as useful as a degree gets you a job 
That might be true for some majors and professions but certainly not for many others 
Edit for example games like chess promote intellectual development 
Puzzles educational videos on academic and topics 
body language interviews lectures etc 
Yes there value to reading papers or researching information 
But the act of reading itself is more a rote skill than an intellectual act 
The actual content is built in the quality of that source 
Often times when people commend reading it indiscriminately focused on the act of reading not the source of the material 
There is not much value in reading if all you read are gossip columnists or those books with as much literary or scientific content as a clickbait article on Facebook 
Just because it on a physical book or an people seem to have the perception that it more edifying 
When I mention reading I do really mean the physical act of interpreting words but reading in a traditional colloquial sense 
As a Chinese person I can only hope to convince you 
Their number IS fake 
Every Chinese know this 
The government lies all the time about stuff like this 
Local officials are very scared Also people in Wuhan have been spreading to places like Wenzhou before the quarantine 
Yes cities were effectively quarantined but the number is definitely higher 
China urban density is very very high 
Yes people are scared but IT can not help but spread fast in China 
The only thing that is good in China about the response are signs that say [UNKNOWN] Which means a dark humor 
Go outside go die 
Thanks 
What video 
What are you talking about 
That a totally different piece of legislation 
That about as meaningless to the executives as one man holding up a cardboard sign 
This is exactly why UBI was and is championed as a way for people to explore their passions and start their own businesses 
What episode is this 
Staples together STRONG 
Yes ideally people should treat as stand alone 
However since people insist on checking history then they should be more comprehensive in that analysis 
It a 
Perhaps a summary could be benefit of the doubt 
Currently the issue is that the de facto motive of action is to agree or check post history 
I sincerely doubt people check post history with anyone they agree with 
But if an unpopular opinion is stated post history is scrubbed only to find specific instances of behavior 
Healthy debate would focus on the current and only the current string of comments in the order they came 
Yet people have been taking them out of order or falsely homing in on only one reply aka out of context 
When it ethos one reply is better to give emphasis on the logic inherent in the reply 
When it logos the chain is better to give an idea of the chain of logic 
In other words if you are going to bring in my previous posts then do so comprehensively and in context 
Otherwise do bother and focus only on the arguments made 
Of course there nuance in everything but that at least a good start 
An example of this would be my fuck it reply 
That only makes sense in context to your original reply when considered with the overall past replies 
But when it specific to a particular technical opinion e Kanna Gollux then focus on simply the chain of reasoning 
Otherwise you would be assuming bad faith 
Does that clarify 
To further add on I have never shyed away from debate 
People complaining about my attitude and post history seem to forget that I been participating in discussions here for years now 
Some have been fruitful but most have not 
When you consider the fruitful discussions such as with MasteringGaming you see that my way of discussion has not varied much 
I took down my guides for a similar reason 
For every constructive feedback there were over a dozen negative comments or even private death threats 
It gotten too far and this Reddit is merely the symptom 
What you saying is the literal definition of a 
Do express your opinion since I do like it and I do want to see it 
It amazing how a simple reply is shoving it down your throats 
I agree with you in that people can have different opinions about Gollux and Commerci 
I said that endlessly at this point 
Stop putting words in my mouth 
Unfortunately it taken me too long to come to the same conclusion 
I still believe it should be but it seems like a Herculean task 
Why is it so rampant inside the Catholic Church 
What kind of systemic problems are there 
I find it hard to believe that this many priests are born as pedophiles 
What is going on to cause them to become attracted to children 
Thanks for laying it out 
See I take things in a very literal way 
My default assumption is that debate requires strong opinions and direct statements 
I assume that everyone and anyone can freely disagree 
When they do it respectfully even if it direct and blunt I respond in kind the majority of the time I still human after all 
Your response is a fantastic example of that 
It respectful and I respond in kind 
You are free to disagree with anything I say at any time and I readily invite that debate 
When I said that Gollux and Commerci is not good I expect people to disagree 
And when they respond I glad to elaborate and hopefully change their opinion 
And here the key if their argument is persuasive I ready to change my opinion too or at least agree towards their reasoning even if I do agree with the conclusion 
For me every post is standalone 
You respond to the content of the post in a direct way 
My issue with the gilded OP is that they automatically assumed what they did which shuts down any attempt at civil discourse and vigorous debate 
Given how popular that comment is do you see why I reacted in the way that I did 
This has happened countless times since I joined here and it only gotten worse in my view 
I think the key to a good debate is the willingness to tell anyone no I think you wrong and here why 
As an adult I do feel the need to sugercoat my words in hopes that people will like me 
I prefer to engage in vigorous debate with no personal attacks 
In my experience with this sub that has rarely succeeded but I try because it the only way to mitigate echo chambers 
If you disagree feel free to respond 
Edit in case it not clear here the main point I believe it a good thing to say to someone no I do agree and here why 
That a productive way to handle debate as long as you do lace it with personal attacks 
And I kept true to that as much as possible only responding in kind when first attacked 
Also I just realized that the gilded OP is you 
Perhaps this is a good example 
I do care that you the person who insulted me 
If you respond kindly I will do the same 
The reverse is also true 
Your initial response warranted anger and I delivered appropriately 
If you disagree that fine 
Let me ask you this should this subreddit be a place for debate 
Do you think it unreasonable after I was already assumed to be condescending by the gilded OP 
My initial OP showed no trace of that 
It seems to me that even when I give a level headed response with Gollux and Commerci I still get that kind of response 
So why try 
Also I have my opinion that KMS is superior does mean I look down on GMS players 
It just means I think the design is better 
How is that at all condescending 
I appreciate your clarification 
Still I think many people still think that Gollux and Commerci are not that grindy which is why I feel the need to repeat myself 
Yes not everyone can magically move to KMS which is why I keep pushing for GMS to be changed 
Can you tell me which line in my OP was inappropriate 
Again where did I do that 
I freely acknowledge KMS has its own issues 
And I said that openly many times 
I not buttering up my words when I give an initially level headed response only to be met with an automatic assumption that I looking down on everyone 
Firmly stating my opinion is not the same as condescension 
Yeah if the first response I receive is you think you better than us 
then of course I get annoyed 
Why do you think I was arguing against you 
I was trying to extend your line of reasoning to another part of the game 
I was diminishing you nor your comment in the first place 
It not fun for the same reason that is fun 
That sounds more like is also not fun than are bigger problems than Kanna 
Yes I favor KMS but where did I think down on players who play GMS 
I have been deliberate in my derision of the GMS game design but not of its players just for being GMS players 
I appreciate you typing it out like this 
Could you understand how your original comment came off as a 
Many kinds of positive foreign references with regards to game design whether to KMS JMS or even TMS on occasion have been met with an automatic oh you think GMS is inferior why u still play 
attitude followed by a string of thinly veiled insults 
You are right 
It is a preference and it something I did not feel the need to clarify 
After all is it not obvious that my opinion is my preference 
Must I begin every response with It is my opinion but to be absolutely explicit that what I stating is not an objective fact 
I have my opinion that the KMS system is superior in its design and that is something that I feel strongly about 
Does merely pointing it out warrant such incredibly negative responses 
Where in my original response did I antagonize the OP 
In fact I was trying to mirror OP Kanna farming for weeks line of argument to other aspects of the game as well 
It was a rather extension with no positive or negative stipulation for OP personality or intelligence and yet the first response I receive is your derisive and passive aggression 
Fuck it 
can go grind your Gollux and Commerci for all eternity for all I care 
Enjoy your bots and shit 
Nobody ever bothers to read the content of these points and just likes to be more savage and woke by insulting anyone with any kind of thought 
Screw it 
I out 
It not fun for the same reason that grinding Gollux accessories and Commerci is fun 
You can plan exactly how much you expect from one hour of gameplay or number of per day and it quickly turns to a job with no chance of any jumps 
At least with regular grinding you have the chance at dopamine shots with nodes droplets boss drops etc 
With that in mind 
I do see how the meso dungeon would bring that kind of RNG joy 
It is more varied which is nice but I think it still relatively dull compared to the many other ways originally viable in this game 
To be more specific they do have our situation with bots causing massive inflation resulting higher star force costs unhealthy flame variance market 
daily boss drops items are nearly all worth the same virtually nothing PQs do give mesos in KMS because they do need to 
There are plenty of other various ways to get mesos 
PQs are just for faster EXP When from Zakum is worth the equivalent of in GMS that starts to add up 
Imagine getting of GMS buying power from two weeklies 
Or maybe of GMS buying power from a decently flamed PB cup 
Have to make that botted meso go in a sink somewhere 
Watching other players get so hyped made it even better https 
That in the doc 
Please scroll down 
Yeah 
That just not possible given our financial constraints 
Who the hell asked for that 
Many KMS players in fact 
Chu Chu and VJ was incredibly crowded and many players complained about and 
Nine rings one earring two pendants one belt one 
But yeah 
You very welcome 
I hope this message gets out to more and more players 
I was completely blind to how much of an impact had until last year 
All I knew was that I hated creating and recreating mules for Gollux and running the same awful voyage every day with no hope of getting lucky 
If possible yes 
Gollux and SW were originally whale traps and have caused of the other bosses rare drops to be entirely obsolete 
They single handedly destroyed any chance at a healthy market 
Mechanator Pendant with various flames the Meister market the Zakum accessory market cPB for Black Bean mark the belt market and practically all other rings in the game 
Hell even certain Dark Boss accessories find it difficult to compete with them 
If everyone has easy access to the BiS equip what the point in doing anything else 
Only recently have certain lategame accessories 
CPap been able to compete but even those are augmented by SW 
It would be a start to creating a healthy economy if they were removed or at least buffed to have better flames again to create market but neither will happen 
The most common argument people have for keeping is that it makes newer players stronger so that they can tackle later content faster 
But what the point in later content if that same later content drops ca be sold or used for anything worthwhile 
What the point in all these items 
Bean Belt Black Bean Chaos Pink Bean Dominator Chaos Zakum Belt Tyrant Belt yes we have but compared to how expensive Tyrants are Gollux is far too accessible Inverse Earrings Ocean Glow Earrings More than Meister Earring for transpose 
If you wanted to transfer hammer you just get cheap Shaman earrings 
Silver Blossom Ring Dea Sidus Earrings these are used only in very so you lose out on that whole market 
Ifia Von Leon Ring can also be in this category which also includes the whole market for Von Leon accessories as a whole you need accessories to craft one ring 
Nearly all event rings and their associated Meister Cubes Zakum Poisonic Face Aquatic Eye EDIT Hell before GMS got stars even nearly all of Absolab Arcane was obsolete too 
We only taken that first step to getting out of that ridiculous meta because of stars but it not nearly enough 
Remember this memo 
http As many of you know in regards to Bonus Stats and flames some equipment obtained from bosses can behave differently than items obtained from regular monster drops 
The items mentioned above do not follow this special behavior due to of these equipment already exceeding the capabilities of other equipment obtained from 
Similar to Superior gear restrictions some of these items may potentially the balance of equipment and power and overall satisfaction with many other content available in 
Ace realized this early on and tried to curb it 
But it still was enough unfortunately 
Given the current GMS player power gap agreed 
I do think it great design from a KMS perspective but we already in too deep 
That is one way to resolve this 
However they would have to increase gains for literally every source in the game from boss crystals to pouches to adjusting inflationary effects on staple items 
CSS which can cause merge issues later on 
What they attempting to do is the better solution which is to decrease the amount of mesos in the game by eliminating bots 
The only key issue with this is the fact that Force prices above stars is absurdly high compared to other so they would have to retroactively decrease SF prices once the inflated meso is under control 
As of now that is not even close to possible 
For reference KMS GMS 
Still you point out an important problem that ought to be addressed 
Unfortunately without systemic account creation 
Lie Detectors the paradigm is unlikely to shift 
I agree with the spirit of this but you have to understand that this is yet another sink to boost the economy 
It gives lower players the market to sell crafting materials to higher players 
This is the case in every MMO and it not just a punitive system for the sake of being punitive 
It a system designed to keep resources flowing throughout the economy 
Relatively minor point but sure 
It a but in the it falls into a reverse situation to the Meister 
players also need to sell Wonderberry pets to someone and mileage KMS only I know need to be spent by players in something 
Again it increases the demand so that players who do roll SSB can at least get something decent for their failed rolls 
It an 
Agreed 
Kishin and Frenzy are honestly just such mechanics to begin with 
No 
They should not be 
If you examine KMS lategamers Hard they actually still have plenty of rare and epic bpots simply from transfer hammer 
If they tiered up to epic players would achieve lategame relatively out of order and will not rely on transfer hammer system as much 
Instead they should let players sell Red Black and Bonus cubes in the AH just as they do in KMS 
This way players will naturally aim for BPot cubes after finishing their main pots while maintaining a decent Rare Bpot 
This should be in conjunction with the KMS structure of Epic Bpot scrolls UPot main scrolls in cube sales 
Ultimately GMS players still wo be satisfied because up is too easy in 
How can a UPot or Epic BPot scroll be worth anything if you can tier up in a couple of cubes 
How can there be any incentive to have a Bpot market without Epic BPot scrolls and a healthy market 
As it is players are gimped to never have bpots and even lesser whales do care about anything but Legendary because Tiering up is not hoped 
If Tiering up was harder ironically players would have access to a much healthier market with which to power up 
Black is winning after

Has ideas like or 
Ah 
That is not clear even from the JMS blogs 
It seems you will feed the familiars into the one with the ability you want 
As to what the higher level will do it is not clear 
Yes 
Do you still receive the same set effects 
I was unable to find an appropriate crossover list of set effects 
If you like power you should rejoice 
JMS familiar is already three or more times better than GMS 
Please note this would be a massive buff 
JMS has the second healthiest economy of all versions 
Thank you 
I must sleep now You seem to have the right idea 
I not sure what you are asking for the second to last quote 
That the key 
It a tendency not an exact statement 
Statistically people who are constrained demonstrate lower IQ 
That does mean every poor person is less analytical stupid but that the majority of people lose intelligence when constrained 
The poor are constrained and so a large number demonstrate less intelligence than they are actually capable of 
We just need to give them money to see their true intelligence 
It a positive message 
Similarly when my family members passed away I was constrained by my grief 
That grief was my limiting factor and I demonstrated significantly less intelligence for the time that I was constrained by grief 
Less analytical less IQ stupid 
However you want to say it I think I have listed out the logical mechanism here quite clearly 
Thank you 
We are all capable of amazing things if only our individual restraints are lifted 
For the poor that just happens to be money 
Please rid yourself of the idea that I am debating against you 
I am simply clarifying OP point and expanding it 
I have no interest in striking you down 
I merely clarified a logical follow up to what you said 
Then what are you claiming 
Why are you angry 
You referring to stupid assuming that intelligence is determined purely at birth 
What OP was saying was that IQ is functionally fluid determined by both genetic and factors like stress poverty and health 
I a pretty well educated guy who deals with mathematics and computer science on a regular basis 
If you took away my food and money I would be able to process these problems nearly as well 
It not an insult it just a humanizing fact 
If people are hungry they less intelligent at that moment in time 
The positive assumption is that if they had food and money and they be much smarter 
Yes 
And a captcha system 
Where can you get this box 
Also worth noting that Scarlett ring can count for set effect 
Not sure if you want it though 
I see 
My mistake 
The free to play player stronger than whales 
Alright 
So your theory is that he is playing the nice cop 

Your OP seems to suggest that LeWaffles is somehow this absurdly counterproductive advertising campaign 
Am I interpreting you correctly 
If so that would be pretty ridiculous 
Maple YouTubers do get anything outside of recognition and some occasional from Nexon 
Any benefit is purely nominal lol 
Perhaps this is clear to GMS players but basically any is an amateur hobbyist at best 
Want to see a for my entire YouTube income in a year compared to the number of hours it took 
It like laboring for an hour

Do you carry a bag on your right shoulder often 
This happens to younger students a lot who carry their heavy backpacks on one strap on their dominant arm 
Just do max your primary throwing star skill until fourth job 
Max Shadow Spark not quad throw 
Hyper stats get the quintuple ones besides Crit get the siphon vitality shield hp bonus and att and dark omen cd cutter 
If early game can also be advisable to switch boss on quintuple hyper to dark omen dmg

You very welcome 
He said lucid which takes around 
Practically for non burst classes 
No I do at all 
Please let me digress into given the nature of the previous cases 
I disagree heavily with Gollux and Commerci meta in the first place having lived through the history of when they were implemented 
Gollux and Commerci came into existence primarily out of greed and are beyond poorly designed 
If someone must go through support to remedy an accident does that not call into question the game itself 
Why are so many items literally 
In KMS the only item even remotely close to this level is Genesis 
Literally everything else can be reobtained with reasonable effort 
Now as before I understand that the NLC equips are not unlike the previous Gollux cases so this case is slightly different 
However are you starting to understand the frustration here 
Is the whole idea of buy back tab meant to be a remedy for accidents 
Surely there can be more effort taken into preventing accidents on a design level 
If not then where else do players go besides support 
We not machines 
Hell even machines make mistakes in my field machine learning 
Is there a reason to be this punitive towards fellow players 
Must we all handle MapleStory like we handling surgery 
It a game it meant to be relaxing fun and a relatively environment 
If a player makes a mistake once every years why should be allowed some support 
Anyway thanks for being civil 
I appreciate the calm response 
Of course it streamer privilege It might benefit you to read his response then 
This sub likes to say that everything good happening to a streamer is streamer privilege when they also have been done for regular players 
Not everyone comes here and posts about their item being extracted missing or sold and yet they are still refunded 
It happens surprisingly often on the Reboot guild Discords 
Streamer privilege is merely confirmation bias because everything we do is recorded and public 
You and OP seem to start the discussion by assuming that streamers have special streamer privilege by default 
While I sure the subreddit is aware of streamer privilege I still like to see what your opinion is of this situation 
What else is there to discuss when the default assumption is that streamers automatically have privilege despite many regular players having the same privilege 
Every time someone extracts an item the comments are flooded with streamer privilege complaints yet when the item is restored nobody cares to think about the receiving privilege 
Nexon support is RNG just like everything else in this game 
That all there is 
How will you test this out 
It situational based on the RNG of the boss and party coordination 
In other words it up to individual preference 
It boils down to Do you want to gamble for burst or be more consistent 
Does your party CD match with your burst or are you only off CD every cycles 
It not so much a mech main question than a what kind of party will I be in 

You essentially trading off boss for level of missiles 
Depending on the boss aka how much burst is set up it can be situational 
I believe missiles is still better due to more consistency aka 
if you miss a burst or it maxes out early phase ends will test etc 

Excellent first two paragraphs

I should clarify someone that ended up being guilty despite being initially acquitted 
The UK does not claim America to be British nor do the Americans claim the UK as their territory

Adele is powerful 
That being said my DB with stat virtually no nodes V skills and no boost and roughly range also soloed in KMS

Puts it in perspective 
Yeah fuck that 
I not doing any guide with NLC until they make it more reasonable 
In the time it takes you to get the ring I could redo this video times get a PhD get married have kids and do Black Mage from a clean account on KMS without understanding the first thing about the Korean language

The lady in this segment really hits home 
I think Andrew Yang understands what a lot of progressives understand which is that the progressive movement and the Democratic Party should be a speakeasy it should be a block party 
It should be some place that everyone is welcome 
You do need to know all the terms or have the right dress code 
That it really a Party that open to everybody and specifically that it a Party that open to men 
do just understand tolerate men we celebrate them 
We do just understand the pain of women and people of color we understand the pain of everyone and we do rank that pain 
That we see that the pain is actually linked 
There a real need for the progressive movement to understand a much more nuanced view of feminism and gender equality not just the future is female which is obviously important but the future is everyone 
If we only talk about women when we talk about gender equality we missing half the picture

It a crazy public school filled with high achieving nerds with a massive variance in interests and visions 
It fantastic stressful and harder than any university 
Many of it graduates go on to top universities in their desired fields and yet still think high school is harder 
It a fantastic breeding ground for talent and hard work 
The majority of the school is made of immigrants and half the student population qualifies for free or reduced lunch 
Very high achieving and American Dream school 
When I was there most students commuted over hours a day slept under hours a night took classes were involved in extracurriculars and many developed university level understandings of many academic fields 
The school regularly churns out national champions in STEM competitions chess and other competitions and even some Junior Olympic athletics 
It has the highest mean SAT score while having very low average household income 
It a school that embodies the phrase overcoming hardship with diligence 
The Tribeca Bridge 
I went to nerd school there 
That so romantic and nerdy at the same time 
Federal Jobs Guarantee

Thanks 
I busy now but I appreciate it 
What is Tmux used for 
In addition the contribution Flag Race and GPQ all contribute to Noblesse Skill acquisition now 
You can think of it as our current flag race system where the top x get y points for each category 
In other words the new contribution system is more pragmatic than our current system 
It part of a larger framework in which you can obtain Noblesse skills through various gameplay throughout the week 
If you do need Noblesse skills the contribution is only to level up guild skills and has no direct flex ranking after your guild achieves a certain level 

That one way to show love 
Anxious existence is the best 
Still ca find it 
Both are great 
This one goes in more depth while Joe goes into the bigger picture future more 
I a first generation college student 
I applied to every top school for computer science the whole gamut from Stanford to Harvard excluding MIT because I did have enough confidence haha 
I was rejected from every single school I cared about and deferred from Princeton 
The one school I had heard about I ended up choosing Georgia Tech 
In hindsight it is a fantastic school with world class education in AI and computer science but high school me had no idea 
When I return to my home state of New York and talk with my friends who went to the Ivies MIT they are all still figuring things out 
Some want to go to med school some work for high tech companies top secret government contractors and some still are searching 
My school did determine any of that 
I could have known 
My effort in college determined that with a bit of luck 
Now I have a job at a top tech company and am doing the kind of AI research I have always dreamed of pursuing 
Had I gone to another school I likely would have obtained the kind of opportunities people and experiences that helped me get my job research friends and career trajectory 
All the people I envied in high school for going to slightly more prestigious universities ended up in the same lattice as me 
The people with more talent but lower University rank still makes far more money 
Ultimately it your work career aptitude opportunity and choices that determine your future 
Sprinkle a bit of luck and your school choice will hardly matter 
For business school it is a bit more relevant but getting into a good MBA does not depend on your undergrad as much as how well you network and achieve 
Good luck 
No I think there are plenty of opportunities if you know the knowledge 
It just depends on what you want to do 
Plenty of academics transition to industry because their work is relevant and valuable 
It definitely still growing 
We have barely scratched the surface of ML 
There is barely even theory for it right now

What are you talking about 
Candidates are complaining that there have not been any debate qualifying polls for days even after the last debate 
That does not seem to be the case 
I recommend looking up his proposal and plan to pay for it 
Not to mention there is plenty besides that tax break that can be adjusted 
There has been a single qualifying poll since the debate 
It been over nearly days lol 
Conspiratorial means without facts this is downright obvious 
So 
It does not 
Most of Europe has a VAT and it works fine 
It is not taxed at all and has no influence on your taxes

https Or just share the audiobook 
It such an easy way to take in his information 
What evidence do you have that churches damage communities 
Besides the handful of churches liberal media like to point out the vast majority of churches provide critical homelessness services food kitchens and donation drives and various community programs 
Top hat would been better imo 
This is one of the books that speak so much truth about our economy AI flow of human talent and capital and the interlocking effects of the solutions 
Very enlightening seven hour listen 
Being an AI researcher I not heard anyone speak so elegantly about so many varied topics and unify them 
They not coming they here 
I strongly suggest you listen to his audiobook 
https Automation is a far larger issue than you might expect 
The bottom of Americans will be impacted by automation at an unprecedented scale and they will not care about the climate if they can not pay their bills 
The following will be within the decade 
What is the point of healthcare when there is no food on the table

After just two hours I liking Vim already particularly the config file lol 
Green apple boy on a bridge 
Honestly it needs to be done for his major policies healthcare to democracy dollars to energy 
This is not slander 
He literally has not given satisfactory responses on AI and automation period 
I followed and donated to his campaign since and artificial intelligence and consequently FJG are the only areas I can not agree with him on 
It my area of expertise and he understand how fast it is progressing and hollowing out the American economy 
I not faulting him for being older 
I simply faulting with him for not talking about automation 
He keep up with the times but he has not 
But he understands technology to a far greater extent than Bernie 
I work directly in AI research and Bernie rhetoric completely misses the point of automation and the impending effects it will have 
Not only are cars and trucks on the road already but they will be in rapidly increasing numbers in the next five years 
My current research directly contributes to automating the machine learning and I can see that future as clear as day 
If you like an explanation of that research feel free to read these earlier comments https I trust Bernie 
But I do trust that he prepared to handle the automative crisis other than with trade deals which has long been an outdated motive of action 
If you like to convince me that Bernie is better than Yang automation is the central topic of interest because it underlies our economic paradigm for this next decade 
I interested in healthcare and energy but automation is the top priority for me and many Americans 
The current welfare system is entrapping 
There are disincentives for anyone to move out of them 
The moment you make more than is allowed for the bracket you lose those benefits and it a vicious cycle 
Even if UBI was just equivalent for those people it at least a positive incentive to work 
Just talk to anyone out in the Midwest and and here in the South 
Those on the margins in between the most poor and the middle class would benefit the most 
Why would you rather have ineffective entrapping services rather than cash 
And yes I mentioned he was aligned with but not exactly for 
His plan goes far beyond that fulfilling its intended goals and more 
Please examine it in more detail rather than just looking for two buzzwords 
If you do want to read the proposal here a decent examination of its effects https 
Medicare for All is good but it not enough given the current American cost system 
LOL 
This made my night 
And he not alone 
Bernie started it but he not enough to implement the solutions properly 
His heart is with the times but not his specific solutions 
EDIT Downvotes do not change opinions 
A wise saying from A picture is worth a thousand words https I love Bernie and I agree with everything you saying 
But I ca completely support Bernie over Yang because political experience is a double edged sword 
Bernie has spent so much time in politics and fighting for social change that he is not aware of the rapid change and effects in AI and applied automation 
He has addressed job automation only with the hammer of government which will not work in this industry I know this from first hand experience as an AI researcher 
Both Yang and Bernie have hearts in the right place 
While Bernie has political experience which demonstrates his heart Yang has relevant business experience which also demonstrates his heart for people 
Entrepreneurship for building jobs and companies for the underprivileged in the Midwest is a demonstration of that heart 
For me the biggest difference is that Yang has modern ideas that have largely been successful or at least been useful towards an organic capitalism which put him ahead in my opinion 
Willingness to consider thorium examine modern problems in detail and take more than just a government regulation and an understanding of the ripple effects of capitalism 
Bernie is like Malcolm X while Yang is like MLK 
He does not simply align with single payer but goes much deeper into fundamentally fixing the system by lowering costs across the board which is one of the effects of single payer 
It a far more comprehensive approach

My general rule of thumb Before comfortable Spark shot alternate between quintuple and spark 
If you see a pack of mobs with mobs use quintuple more bats 
Otherwise use spark 
After Spark for everything is okay 
Quintuple can technically be better if no kish but is rarely due to GMS speed cap 
Their Glassdoor reviews and salaries https certainly speak a lot lol 
Their software engineer salaries are average at best and can be slightly below average depending on location 
Reviews Summary Pros You will work with a lot of great people in reviews Lots of cool perks such as basketball court food etc in reviews Cons Difficult communication since they all speak Korean in reviews balance was a challenge for my position but that not the case for everyone in reviews One really stood out to me from Oct Very culture 
People are expected to shut up and do what they told Upper are clueless about what makes a game good and the Western market in general 
Expected to compete against the best with little resources manpower and terrible leadership and lack of vision 
Sounds about right 
Whoever would want to fight against the culture be skilled enough to lead a team of average engineers to turn the game better would have left a long time ago for better cultures and better pay 
Internal bots are strictly against TOS so this is impossible 
However external programs are grey areas depending on their application 
You could pop external chat out and build a CV text recognition algorithm based on periodic screenshots 
If such a program is properly isolated from Maple 
external server program that inputs screenshots from a legal program like PrntScr and outputs chat towards Discord chat you could do it 
Is it worth the effort 
Depending on your CV proficiency I suppose 
I know people who have used CV for actually nefarious purposes but it certainly a lot more difficult than just text Discord bot

Do underestimate your ability to contribute 
https is just one I found in a few seconds 
I am sure you can contribute to more code than you realize 
I do have very much time today but I will try to explain as much as my time will allow 
If this does not make sense please let me know and I will try to explain from a different analogy 
There is a recently developing field called AutoML which stands for Automatic Machine Learning 
This field attempts to replicate machine learning algorithms automatically as the name suggests 
I tried to write this response once but I got too technical so let me try again 
Current Paradigm Assume one letter is one layer and that layer has a few hyperparameters 
attributes You can think of a neural network like this input A B C D output Machine learning has made a boom because our computing power has allowed us to easily test many hyperparameters of each of these letters for relatively small networks especially since we only testing a few combinations 
performance of these small networks tend to plateau so we do need to test millions of hyperparameter values only hundreds or thousands 
Now a smart experienced person in the field might know that A should always come before B because A prepares the data for B in a certain way that made B more effective 
But what if the network grows bigger and bigger 
We do know the effect of every layer effect on every other layer 
Future 
There are an infinite number of networks possible because there is no guarantee that a larger network is somehow worse than a smaller one 
It only that we prefer smaller ones because our computers are able to handle them faster 
In other words how do we know that this is not even better for a particular problem 
input B A C D Z theta D C A output The motivation behind AutoML is that it lets computers help us compute more varied kinds of structures 
I only shown linear examples here but there are many more complex ways to represent neural networks and computers deal with those structures far better than we can 
Our current research attempts to simply start with the letters and randomly build combinations of networks with limitations of course 
Then we evolve those networks by changing parts and pieces in order to see if that would improve it 
It turns out that testing one network may only take an hour or two but testing hundreds of them can take a long time 
This is one of the biggest bottlenecks we have and it one of the ways our research attempts to take clever shortcuts in order to speed it up 
In other words we taking the idea of human evolution and treating one network as a human and evolving it over time 
I wish I could speak in more detail but unfortunately I have yet to fully understand genetic programming current state of the art so I can only simplify so much 
Generalized AI To answer your question right now is trying to make a system that can try more interesting combinations of those letters to ultimately generate one or two best models for any given problem 
I once heard a colleague describe generalized AI as not one fancy model that magically describes the universe but hundreds of thousands of paths each of which is a complex deep learning model that handles problem really well 
In your words it like a collection of find the optimal structure then run with it models 
Current models that learn as they go do not change the order of the letters just the way that the letters interact with one another 
I not sure if adaptive learning is possible for the but that is an interesting idea for research 
Personally I think there are two issues 
Human Inperfections 
greed hoarding power hunger etc 

Lack of Work Diversity For sake of time you can think of as the billionaires not willing to pay taxes and give enough back to society 
You can think of as a general inability for the average person to do more and more skilled labor in the current economy 
I personally think that some of the most currently valuable work is inherently not possible for the average person whether on an intellectual level or a management one 
The clearest example of this is Everyone should code No 
Everyone should not code 
Not everyone is naturally gifted enough to code well 
Everyone code but are they able to do that well 
We all have our different talents and abilities 
That is the beauty of humanity in my opinion 
The problem we have is that some talents and abilities are valued too much in our current society because there are rich and powerful people who can benefit from those talents 
For example I am good at writing software 
My skills can make some company a lot of money therefore I get paid a lot more than an average worker 
My hope is that we can see past this paradigm and focus on how each of us can harness our natural talents and make good livings off of what we naturally gifted at whether that in STEM humanities art music or anything else 
It a problem of incentives not of talent in my view 
Furthermore in the future distinctly human qualities like empathy sympathy and conscience will be far more important in shaping human civilization 
We will need technical people to handle the technology but those human qualities will cause us to make decisions that can ruin or save our society 
Capitalism is failing because we simply measured GDP 
Yang is on the right track when he wants capitalism 
It not perfect but it a wonderful start 
We need to expand on that vision of capitalism more than anything else because soon we will have no option 
Oh I appreciate that 
I actually been researching Yang in depth for about half a year now 
If anything I like to understand the Bernie Yang comparison on policies in detail as much as possible technically 
What is Yang detailed stance on 
Nuclear Renewables Carbon Tax 
AI 
Automation 
Infrastructure I have a general sense that he is focused on telling us that these things will happen in a number of ways but I have seen him predict in more precise detail 
the kinds of technologies etc 
I like his vision but I have completely grasped his solution as an overarching package 
For example what kind of numbers would tie those four issues above together 
I agree with his overall views but since I a more technical and precise person I would like to discuss action items more than general direction 
In other words what specific kinds of technology would replace truckers in his view 
How will they be implemented and what leaps would need to be achieved 
When people are helped by UBI how will we organize the economy even further to not just ensure that people have good live but that R D is available to more people 
open source 
I sorry difference between Yang and Bernie 
Very well written and cited 
This has been my intuition as well 
I hope proponents of FJG can write in a similar manner 
Unfortunately I will also soon be a software engineer by day 
But it fun being Researchman at night 
I will consider it 
I am still learning even within the confines of my own research much less AI in general 
I would love to be a part of such an AMA one day though 
I like to quote one of my favorite YouTube educators CGP Grey 
The usual argument is that unions will prevent it 
But history is filled with workers who fought technology that would replace them and the workers always loose 
always and there are huge incentives across wildly diverse industries to adopt autos 
Humans Need Not Apply https If you have watched it already I highly recommend it 
This is one of the handful of videos that really hit the nail on the head 
Thank you 
I have been keenly aware of Yang and his policies over the last year and I would be lying if I said I have found him immensely fascinating 
He has the same kind of dedication towards and thinking I often do and he is often such an eloquent orator 
Personally I wish he would emphasize the details of the automation revolution to gain more support amongst the technical audience but I suppose it difficult to balance complexity with a broad reach 
I was wavering between Bernie and Yang and this FJG is pushing me over to Yang the more I think on it 
That seems to be my experience in the last few years 
I never liked echo chambers and I glad this Yang sub and are places I can turn to 
This is honestly a massive challenge to our society 
Although I am just one relatively inexperienced person in the AI field I hope that I can do my part to shed some light on this 
This stuff is truly complex and requires years of intense education and knowledge to even begin to understand with any significance 
There a reason why some of the top researchers can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in private industry 
I hope that anyone who has any questions about the future of automation as least as far as it relates to artificial intelligence can ask them 
I will try my best to provide at least a basic overview of my understanding and how I believe it will shape particular sectors of the economy 
It will not be comprehensive nor exhaustively accurate but I hope it will provide at least some context into what degree of velocity intelligent automation has 
For reference would you quote the exact portion 
Yep 
I wrote in Bernie in because I firmly believe in voting for the candidate you believe in not the one you believe will win 
Needless to say I will be voting as soon as we are able to 
Although a reminder from this sub when the time comes would be helpful 
Haha ironically I hate the math 
But it too beautiful of a theory for me not to try to understand it 
Ah my mistake then 
Nevertheless I encourage you to give it a shot 
You are very fortunate to not be in need 
I come from a family of immigrants and I worked hard all my life to get to where I am and where I want to go 
I love working and it honestly horrifies me whenever I can not continue with a project or work 
My work means so much to me because I have a vision of how my work may eventually serve to better humanity if used correctly and it so deeply interesting to me 
But I also recognize that not all of life 
I love my hobbies my community and this country for letting me come here and have a good life 
When Yang says I a son and a patriot and I see the country we are leaving for our children I feel that more that I can express 
I do want to live in a society where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer because we have intelligent machines 
I want to live in a society where our newfound intelligence can be applied to improve our societal and economic systems to help everyone from the needy to the blessed 
Yang Industrial Revolution Maybe if other people used that term and it caught on in the mainstream I would have needed to mention it 
Try going over there and posting what I said without Yang name in it 
Seriously 
I would love to see what happens because I still curious about that discussion 
I wish I could ask Bernie directly about FJG but I ca currently vote in a swing state and I not Media so I guess I never see him 
That exactly my problem 
I like and plenty of Bernie policies 
I also like Yang policies a lot 
But FJG is that one major red flag that seems like a huge bureaucratic nightmare with inane costs to little effect 
It might have worked in the when there was virtually no automation 
But AI is being applied and improved too quickly nowadays 
FJG simply sounds disastrous to me and not a single person has been able to respond to me convincingly on that 
Honestly if Bernie were to remove FJG from his platform I might weigh him and Yang equally 
But at this point it too risky 
It still in the works so I ca say too much 
But essentially my team and I are attempting to create a system that can create various neural networks automatically 
It would create them in a structure that is far more computationally efficient by not needing to recompute the same layers 
For those familiar with some graph theory it evolves a directed acylic graph such that each node is a layer 
The system evolves that DAG structure over time to create networks beyond our current approach to organizing and optimizing a neural net 
In theory this can be applied to any kind of neural network problem with the right components 
Currently we are focusing on benchmark computer vision datasets 
laymen terms we essentially creating an automated way of creating the intelligence behind self driving cars and facial recognition 
Oh and by the way convolutional neural networks the focus of our current automation were even popular until when Alex Krizhevsky first released AlexNet 
in short years many people are already attempting to automate the creation of the technology that is replacing truckers 
This means that if we or some other team are successful this technology will improve and apply to far more areas than anyone can anticipate 
This is the message from another moderator a few months ago https This is Bernie Economic Bill of Rights https It does not mention automation 
Neither does his Green New Deal https as far as I can tell 
I have also yet to see the discussion that was promised 
I still love Bernie but I sorely disappointed by his subreddit 
I just a researcher deeply concerned by the effects of my work and it seems nobody else is willing to discuss it 
was not there to advocate for Yang 
My OP was pretty clear in that I just wanted to see what other Sanders' supporters had to say about his policy because I thought I had missed the automation part 
But since the mod locked the thread I ca reply with this thought so I thought I come here 
Edit For the record I messaged that mod https about his removal 
I guess we see 
Edit Okay I been banned from that sub 
No more Bernie for me I guess 
https If you do want to discuss policy then I will assume the policy is not effective 
Simple as that 
Edit This is probably unimportant but I just realized I typed FBJ when I meant FJG lol 
Edit Original Post from months ago https Hello CodeUmbra 
Your submission is being removed because it is about a topic that has been extensively posted and discussed within this community 
So yeah that mod is just incorrect 
That when you go to the really really big maps 
Try turning off sound effects 
It one less thing to load when mobs die 
I been having a rough few days but seeing your sweet smile brought so much comfort 
You have a beautiful and innocent smile 
And since you look fairly young please let me just say that life will always be difficult 
But as you get older you will discover more fun pleasures and valuable experiences as you have more control over what you do and who you spend time with 
Do listen to social media 
After all who would post a picture of them lying lazily on the couch on Facebook 
Take it from a software engineer 
Focus on your work hobbies and friends 
Social media is designed specifically by engineers like myself to make you feel this way it not your fault and nothing is wrong with ya 
You got this bud 
Oh by the way guys like girls who have appearance as an afterthought 
You look so pretty just as you are do worry 
remindme days 
remindme days 
Included it in the thread 
Thanks for your input 
Yes 
Corrected 
Can you please edit this with the names and amounts of each passive 
Thank you 
I already linked your response 
Fixed 
Got it 
Adjusted the links 
Attack speed is not necessary 
As far as links go they seem to be ordinary 
I can see this line of thought 
From what I gather it seems to be a playstyle choice 
Some have also said that you do really need to prioritize CD skip that much as iframes typically will be enough 
I make a note 
Thank you 
Perfect 
Thank you 
Would CD ignore be useful at all with Ender 
Has it been changed since KMST https 
Can you give the breakdown for Bishop 
Last time I was told it was possible https 
Thanks 
Perfect explanation 
Thank you 
I think I understand 
No link skill recommendations for now then 
Yeah that seems to be consistent with the current one 
Thanks 
Lol 
Can you give the crit rate breakdown please 
D 
Gotcha 
Honestly that was probably just a typo lol 
Is Enchanted Quiver no longer a thing or does that just not need buff duration compared to att now 
Edit also as far as link skills go do you take phantom 
what is your setup the recommended 
Perfect 
I reference this in the notes 

Given the current link skills tab what other link skill would you replace for Kinesis 
are already taken EDIT Can you please give the crit rate breakdown too 
Thank you 
This is excellent 
Interesting about the Jett link 
What your weapon multiplier and current 
roughly is okay 
Gotcha 
Linked this in the thread 
Thank you 
Great explanation 
Thanks 
D 
Let me make sure I understand what you saying for the crit rate base BT Hyper Stat DSE Assuming no Phantom link what is the breakdown 
we could use hyper 
when smokescreen ca be used Can you give an example 
I not sure I follow 
Perfect thank you 
Edit would you say att ignore 
Also what about ignore and boss 
Thanks for the level of detail 
This is excellent 
I updated the sheet EDIT Got it included that too 
Any link skill changes 
What makes Buff Duration less important than crit 
Pretty much this 
In addition if we were to discuss quality of the C code in detail we would have to talk more technically about a few topics which generally require decent amounts of technical knowledge 
For example memory leaks context switching offloading protocols and stateful and stateless packet handling exhaustive graceful exits etc 
Not only is this difficult to do on its own it even more difficult to do without direct access to source code 
Welcome to MS Equipment Theory and Optimization https In this course we will be examining Nox keynote lecture in 
The MapleStory department at the University of Nexon has archived this one hour lecture for all students interested in equipment theory in MapleStory Reboot 
Nox is a close friend of mine and I can say that he has been diligent in keeping the footnote resources up to date but there may be some gaps 
Regardless they will include overviews of material covered in your previous coursework including Elementary Crafting Transfer Hammer and Transposing Applied Mechanics and Experience If you would like to learn more after viewing this lecture please feel free to check out his other guest lectures 
These lectures have been featured in other courses such as MS Inner Ability Optimization https Special Topics Advanced Night Walker Nox is currently pursuing his second doctorate degree in MapleStory in Korea 
However he has informed me that he is currently working on an updated series of lectures with the help of a close partner 
He has not announced any concrete dates but is expected to release them over the first few months of 
Lol 
It probably more of a legal thing with financial aid tracking 
Just be careful that you may need to register for a filler class that maintains your student status 
Some schools make it so that you have to reapply as a student if you do sign up for classes for more than semesters 
Roughly speaking this is a pretty accurate list 
The top is almost scarily so 
The interesting caveat is they are almost all different for different reasons or at least a healthy mix of all 
chaining combos skill timing SK 
I forget the source but I heard it does 
You wo have 
Probably not the biggest concern but just keep that in mind lol 
Very well made 
Note that transposing from Ocean Glow Oz or Inverse Kritias Earrings is technically BiS by att 
Sup is still optimal given imaginary dreamy belt 
In other words if you were being banned before by Arkanna okay 
As far as the equipment goes I disagree 
Equipment does become obsolete in this game anymore certainly not at six months 
Only thing you could say on this is SW transposed but they are still very good 
That being said ring fully upgraded would be about equivalent to a star ring 
So if you very unlucky and boom you could try another ring with those event rings as substitute 
I assuming this ca be used as a replacement for a boomed equip 
It mostly due to MapleStory M retracting after launch boom 
Some absolutely gorgeous items both in stat and appearance 
Good luck 
Fair enough 
Please see my edits if you have already 
Better just in economic sense that undeniable I think 
Yeah 
I do think I ever claimed GMS is successful lol 
And I agree with you 
There should be mechanisms in place to prevent this from going to kids under 
I emphasized that KMS was successful once again to point out that KMS is still far more successful than GMS is 
That my one and only point in this thread 
is much better objectively speaking than GMS 
This is likely due to the game and economy design from account creation to minute game elements like I listed earlier 
That it 
I not making any extra claims here about how Maple is healthy for kids or whatever 
By health I just meant economic health particularly when compared to GMS 
I not here to provide the normative solution to is Maple good for society 
I just here to say KMS is healthier than GMS and here are some of the reasons why 
I not throwing out your psychological points because I do want to answer them I think they really good points and I fundamentally agree with them to a degree 
I throwing them out because you practically strawmanning what I saying lol 
There is hope yet 
Since my incident I tracked at least a number of players who had lost items ranging from the replaceable to Gollux due to NPC extraction and accidental dropping 
Most have been successful if they get the good GMs 
As few have not typically due to the rarity of the equipment 
We have to agree to disagree here 
I fundamentally do see Maple as that much of an addiction trap because I not addicted to it but I guess I just conditioned differently 
It served as quite a balancer in my life over the years 
It not exactly a matter of blind elitism for KMS 
The numbers just prove that whatever they doing they relatively successful at it for the Korean market 
Whether that good in your eyes is up to you 
EDIT What should change from KMS 
Cubes 
Flames 
RNG in general 
This is still an MMO 
What I hear you saying is that Maple should lose all of its RNG systems in total except that from it inception Maple has always had increasingly intense RNG 
From Gachapon scrolling and Mastery books to now 
Maple has never been a perfect game 
But you are missing the forest for the trees 
KMS may have it own set of problems but spend even a month on KMS and you see the difference 
Suddenly everything from crafting to mining to ebosses to every boss is actually profitable and immensely helpful 
There are so many points of difference that it unfathomable how well tuned KMS is unless you actually logged in and given it an honest try 
Of course these problems exist in Maple 
But KMS is still miles ahead of GMS 
If you do believe me just take a look at AH and think about the relationships of the items 
Game design flame disparities for economy Ark primals confusion fragments transfer hammer for low level items making them worthwhile occult cubes low reveal price for a varied AH no meaning every boss has at least one item worth a long time boss crystals actually scaled properly being very profitable casually mileage system to avoid players being trapped behind MX 
There are so many differences I ca even list most of them 
The meso value in KMS changes so much of what we know to be true in GMS 
It unbelievable 
Bots do exist but to even begin to claim they are anywhere close to GMS levels is justnot true 
Every KMS account is eventually tied to some kind of govt ID whether Korean or foreign 
The lie detector system may not totally stop bots but it limits their effectiveness a lot All you need is minutes in the AH to see this effect compared to GMS 
All your other points about psychology are not relevant to my post at all given my comparison was between GMS and KMS 
And for you get real 
There are not bots on KMS lol 
Say what you will but GMS servers will not get these Reboot players 
I playing KMS right now and the difference in health and game design is like comparing GMS to 
Not disagreeing just continuing 
Does KMS not have a level penalty 
That news to me 
I could find him specifically giving that a greenlight but he did not ever mention anything about this being illegal even though it been very public knowledge and the community has been explicitly asking for alternatives for over a year now 
That not much of a solution frankly 
It be a different story if Fury Totem was easily accessible and possible after hours 
Unless everyone mains Kanna that disparity will only grow for anyone wanting to farm more than hours a month 
Not even to mention the funding required to farm after a certain level 
Just my two cents 
mb 
Do worry 
We had some discussions about Reboot cap Bera videos 
It impossible right now 
This might be applicable if the rules are low stakes but if it something actually serious or confidential that not exactly good advice 
How about just doing a bit of extra research and not sending your students to a talk that they ca enter 
Depending on the nature of the talk it could very well be restricted for legitimate reasons 
Ah that interesting 
Seems like a huge security risk lol 
Does it 
what is it used for 
Certainly does match mine 
Was there a grandma on this sub a year ago 
Might be datamined from TMS given the Chinese 

Those are good things to fix but honestly if they want more people to play servers for more than a month they have to fix the economy 
And change value to not substitute crafting every other early boss in the game and basically the entire transfer hammer system 
I been playing KMS from ping and I have to say it still far FAR smoother than GMS ever was 
For context my avg GMS ping is 
Kenna given his weapon choice 
You not wrong but there is still skill in persuasion 
An engineer may not always have the abject authority but often times they able to make judgment calls in these situations and persuade PMs with excellent technical communication 
As far as FAANG goes senior engineers have a lot of control on their projects believe it or not 
The handwaving thing I ca give you any harder proof than to just say that you be able to understand when you step into more variety of industries and work in more environments for a long time 
There are evil things being done but there are things individuals can do to mitigate those within the orgs 
There no definite answer here except for personal anecdotes and general industry experience and interaction 
Any more debate is likely more philosophical in nature 
Yeah 
You can 
it may not be the best fit for you to make social change 
But for others it the best job suited for their abilities 
FAANG is an amazing place to train SWE skills which can be applied to many humanitarian efforts 
After all would you ask a wrestler to work on drafting humanitarian policy or would you say it more effective for him to wrestle well earn respect and promote good at the top of his profession and donate to charity 
Btw downvotes do change opinions 
Edit rephrasing 
And think about how much more terrible these companies would get if there every social good engineer left and the company had no one to drive a moral and ethical vision in their projects 
I think it honorable you want to drive social change presumably but recognize that good can be done within a company as well as without 
Sometimes the former can be even more effective 
If you wanted to stop a war you could protest the government or you could join the military and become a general 
You gain pathos and ethos with the people actually making the decisions in order to make the right one 
And then maybe you also understand more what you did before why people make decisions the way they do 
Often times it a far more complex problem and evil decisions are always made out of malice 
Sometimes the people making the decisions just do fully comprehend the effects so maybe if you or I were there we could think better and act better 
It never so black and white 
Sometimes it just takes one engineer to say you know maybe we should focus on educational content and maintaining attention instead of short buzzy news on Youtube 
What wrong with that 
Part of it might be bandwagon but ML is a genuinely interesting field of research 
It sounds like a lot of gatekeeping in this sub honestly 
There will always be people who think they qualified but actually are not 
This is the same for the people who say they a full stack engineer but have only done Squarespace Bootstrap 
GTPD is chill 
Masteria Through Time is the best we ever get sadly 
The Grandmasters was such a beautiful concept 
Skill Animation https JMS just had their offline event so details are out yet

How memory intensive is this 
That being said being proficient in projects might get you a job but may not help you keep it or advance 
Grades are relatively easy to get if you put in enough effort and it often important to put in that last grit it takes to keep an A over a B 
That grit is a habit and grades help build it 
Academic research is also a very good indicator of how good a person is with working on unspecified requirements and vague projects 
during first release of VJ 
Fifth job was such an exciting release 
Probably but considering Maple is now in NA we may have leverage to get better servers 
revenue decrease primarily due to the deceleration of Darkness Rises and MapleStory M MapleStory is still listed as the number one title in NA

To your first point you just restated what I said 
Congrats Second I did say anything about Christians being superior 
Unless you been living under a rock you see countless stories of young people growing up under Christian families converting away and rejecting tradition here in America 
Frankly I do even want to continue this senseless discussion with you 
Literally all my response said was the trends and facts of the periods as well as my experience in China 
Your last sentence just shuts down any discussion and tries to insult personally which is not fitting for this sub 
You literally assume something about me and then assume I arrogant based on your assumption 
Lol get over yourself 
Oh and by the way my family is split half Christian and half mystical Buddhist 
One half sold mystic charms and the other served in the clergy after converting away from Shaolin Buddhism 
What do you possibly know about me and my beliefs 
And before you start confusing the kinds mystical Buddhism is a different branch from Shaolin Hindu and even other branches of Chinese Buddhism 
Some have pagan traditions whilst others have more Buddhist roots 
It a very different society years ago first of all 
You did convert to Christianity because it was cool you converted to it under punishment of death or vice versa under Constantine 
You converted primarily because you and often your family genuinely believed in the message of Christianity 
There was a significant risk in doing so and simply being is not a valid excuse when you under torture or executive threat 
You could see the same happening years ago in Communist China where I am from 
People in pagan or more accurately mythical religion believed it simply because their families did for generations 
The traditional religion of the West eventually became Christianity and it is why you see people nowadays treat them under the same light 
But fundamentally traditionalist I go to church because my family does Christians real I believe in the primary message of the Gospel and want to know God Christians are very different things 
In pagan mythical religions that distinction is typically only made at the temple level 
you either are traditionalist Buddhist or a full blown monk 
Young people nowadays choose pagan religion mostly out of pop culture like OP mentioned 
This is an entirely different set of beliefs because they do really believe but it not even tradition either 
It just pop culture not much more than that 
There is no common rituals for weddings funerals scriptures or anything 
Otherwise they would choose atheism which is generally different and is about as light as traditionalist

Is this guy trying to do solos with all three thieves 
Lol 
EDIT For att boss you are correct 
Please see my edits above 
As for the Crit I disregard Phantom link since we have an abundance of link skills Dmg which would be better than status damage in any case since it a direct comparison 
How do they factor into the damage formula then 
Have you guys managed to create an even better closed form equation for damage 
o Also out of curiosity this may or may not be relevant for this discussion have you guys considered whether using a Current Multiplier formula by pinning the other variables would cause local optima 
Thanks for tagging me 
Please if this ever comes up share my response above 
That was an interesting use of minutes 
EDIT Okay this sparked a much longer conversation than I was expecting 
I since updated the IA guide to reflect all the information would need to know 
If anyone has questions on ATT Boss either read the middle EDIT section ask Rob to explain it to you 
If you just a Mapler who does like math just read the IA guide lol 
Thank you for your contributions 
Hello 
I do really understand what you saying since your grammar towards the end is unconventional 
But let me try to help 
future readers all I ask is for some appreciation into the mathematics 
These guides look simple but are immensely difficult to craft 
Please save this explanation to share in the future 
Let me try to clarify some concerns This guide was primarily made before stars when attack was particularly difficult to get for all servers so the boss was pretty reasonable to ignore back then 
For stars it gets very complicated 
I like to avoid writing a mathematical reasoning through the damage formula since there like variables to consider but for the sake of argument please come take a peek inside my head 
The general thought process is that most classes follow the following scheme The first set of classes are under the following scheme Boss or something like Ignore because they have passives or certain conditions that require the Buff Phantom link is simply not good enough to replace a damage link 
So for the sake of your question because we have boss the ATT is just a default 
Now for the remaining classes and this is why I despise calculating GMS hard cap meta we have something along the following Att Speed Are you starting to understand the comparative logic 
If we have Buff then it depends on the class typically a mage and how their individual weapon multiplier fares against Crit 
In most cases classes that need Buff have low weapon multipliers and thus crit and damage link by extension would be more beneficial over Crit 
If we have Crit free third line the choice would then be between Att or Boss 
This is where things get a bit hairy as you will see 
First let take a closer look at the particular values you are able to receive for that third line since you will be using Honor EXP to roll 
Circs for line honor for and third right remember 
So you have the following range of values possible boss in increments of 
in increments of 
For simplicity sake let say the mathematical expectation aka first moment assuming continuous RV probability to roll boss ATT 
You may think of this as a balanced discrete probability but for all we know about the data this could very well be a continuous random variable with randomness subject to some kind of RNG 
The legit community has no clue into the code unfortunately 
Now this is where I must skip the mathematical reasoning because the damage formula is complicated and admittedly there is no feasible way for me to calculate and Att Boss superiority as you soon begin to see 
However allow me to illustrate it with a simple single variable comparison in the hopes that this will be enough to convince you 
ATT Base Attack Attack Base Final Attack https Actual Damage AD Weapon Multiplier StatValue Rough Damage Formula https AD Skill Damage BossDamage CriticalDamage PDR IED ElementalResist IgnoreElementalResist FDB For clarity I will refer to Damage and Boss Damage as the same Dmg 
As you can see AD and Dmg scale one another 
You are somewhat correct to suspect that Dmg would increase AD by a certain factor 
EDIT Robert and I have discussed it and it seems in theory Boss would be favored attack 
The actual damage increase would be relatively marginal FD 
However this would change depending on what exact value you roll 
For example or boss may not be better for Reboot depending on your total attack 
However for feasibility purposes probability of roll variance etc 
I will put both as roughly the same 
Generally for an average Reboot endgamer seems to ATT 
For would be better by that slight margin 
I will edit the IA guide to reflect that approximate equality 
Finally let zoom back out a bit 
Both these lines are generally considered third lines 
In your particular case I put Hero Attack Crit as the second line primarily because it is particularly hard to cap Crit with the legion board 
There are a LOT of factors here from Hyper Stat optimization Crit Damage to Legion board comparisons Stat IED Crit Rate 
For everyone peace of mind over this tiny amount of damage I suggested Crit Rate is less important because it could be made up with Legion and if you ever have a Bowman real Sharp Eyes 
Not to mention if you ever short in Crit it will only ever be within where we then even have to consider BT link every other Dmg link 
You see how this question spirals out of control 
Even with the most recent Glory patch adding more Dmg links we add more variables to optimize 
I have even gotten into probabilistic calculations for Crit Rate 
and so much more 
MapleStory meta calculations should be considered a PhD dissertation topic 
Second line unique boss is marginally better than ATT may not be for Rebooters but definitely is for regular server 
Very nice this is my legion mule strategy 
A few additions Easy Magnus for star Shoulder it rare but also quick Craftsman Cubes for Epic att Bye Bye Station Elite bosses and do the reward stages to loot the weapon and armor pieces 
These pieces can be epic and give boss flames which is far better than KFT 
But they not always available so KFT is a good fallback 
att on weapon this way too 
After Glory we also get damage reduction and healing along with damage boost as Cygnus fifth job skill 
Our bind is suboptimal though EDIT By healing I mean the new Cygnus skill Transcendent Cygnus' Blessing For seconds your damage will be increased by and you will take reduced damage from enemy attacks including HP attacks 
Every few seconds heal of your HP and MP and increase your damage by 
The damage boost is additive and can stack up to 
Cooldown seconds 
Of course not 
Their client is still smoother though 
Pretty much a symptom of GMS 
I do know if it the large region support additional crap or mismanagement but KMS does seem to have any of these issues 
Hell not even JMS seems to have that many issues 
When I broke up with a close friend half a year ago 
It okay 
At least you successful in your career 
Spoken like someone who does go to lecture and just reads the book 
Lol 
You do want to go there 
It nice in theory but it practically unusably disgusting 
Not but 
delta 
delta 
If anything my bet is on AF daily in the next KMS patch with the new area 
Since this game started focusing on solely grind and gear progression dailies long grind is the only way to keep people playing 
Might have been inevitable since PQs events and blockbusters can only keep attention so long in a month patch cycle 
If you do want to properly respond to my first set of points why would I waste time writing a second list 
I not going to validate your distracting response by treating it as a legitimate argument 
Respond properly then you can expect a logical continuation of the argument 
Yang has convinced me of anything 
Automation and AI is my specialized field of research from a top international university 
You can believe it or not but that what the minimum wage increase will do 
I could give less of a shit about what Yang thinks 
It is going to happen because it literally common sense and I see it in my work literally every day 
It quite literally how so much of this research gets funded outside of DoD and NAE grants for specific implementations into missile guiding systems and other narrow topics 
I do have time to respond to all your points but you not so much responded to my points as just ignored them just because they libertarian and thus automatically bad 
You not playing logical just identity politics 
I let you have the last word if you decide to respond 
People like you make me sad for Bernie 
I love what he does and I have always been a hardcore supporter since April but this campaign has really attracted some terribly misguided people 
I mean We can sit here and talk about communism but that never happening in the US 
So of our options which are the best 
FJG with minimum wage increase or UBI 
But the problem is that our current welfare system is not flexible 
Since Yang UBI is opt IN it still an overall plus for those who prefer welfare 
He is not advocating welfare removal but a second option which most welfare Americans would prefer 
After all a dollar spent on welfare is not as efficient as a dollar given to the poor directly 
It a rather libertarian thought but it makes sense given our current bureaucratic system 
Poor people know what they need 
The government ca it an imperfect knowledge system as we say in the AI field 
As for the minimum wage increase I for the spirit of it but it do more harm than good 
All it does is increase the incentive for automation 
As a deep learning researcher a big part of convincing companies to use expensive researchers is to show how we can save them money 
Making workers more expensive will make their lives worse unfortunately 
UBI reduces those effects since it an externality to the company I believe 
And what about people who ca and wo be employable since their jobs are automated 
What does a minimum wage do when the poor do even have a job 
A federal jobs guarantee is doomed to waste tons of money in bureaucratic nonsense with little to show for it 
There a reason we have tractors to dig roads not people with shovels 
Might be a newsflash but our welfare system is horrendously ineffective 
Why do you think it worse than welfare 
No 
It was fun with a few friends but I could possibly imagine enjoying that as an adult 
Out of lack of knowledge I know it a little difficult to empathize with your average student but not everyone wants to or has the time to dig into Linux for hours 
It just like how not everyone wants to setup Vim or Emacs and just wants to settle with Sublime or an IDE 
I have my opinions about what I like to use but not everyone wants to do that 
Linux Mac is the same issue 
You can theoretically do everything you want in Linux but is it worth the time to relearn everything 
It like faulting someone for choosing what brand of car they buy just because it not technically superior 
We all have preferences and everything has tradeoffs 
The default behavior of so many Linux masterrace people is to say that Linux is superior in everyway and I am inclined to agree 
But you have to keep in mind your audience sometimes 
I think you make excellent points 
I agree with a good portion of your points and I not trying to flame you either 
I still use Linux all the time 
At least for me out of the box Linux just is that efficient for certain tasks 
Maybe that out of ignorance but I not like to spend the time to Google Linux alternatives for everything lol 
You entitled to your opinion too of course 
I do think it a little immature to downvote someone might not be you for purely not falling in line with the hardcore Linux user and be technically inferior like the other reply seemed to insinuate 
You can use VPN 
I ca give you a tutorial on how to do that but I know several people from Thailand who connect to GMS using some paid VPNs 
The ping is not too bad 
Managing Chrome tabs effectively with Chromium performance issues up Linux support for certain applications video editing and often times even common apps like Spotify are buggy at best 
Not to mention the whole host of menu apps like SpotMenu univeral media Bearded Spice Alfred etc 
There are Linux alternatives to some but it very difficult to replicate a professional workflow from Mac 
Individually you can type docs and do all that but not nearly with the same efficiency in the long term 
I love Linux but I ca live in the terminal my whole life as much as I would like to 
The cost to configure and risk of incompatibility at a moment notice is far too large 
It the same problem Emacs has as much as I love it 
EDIT Btw a downvote is contributing to the discussion lol 
You either live in the command line for maximum efficiency in Linux or you do bother 
I love to do that but it such a steep learning curve with massive risk 
Linux is great 
The issue is when daily driving for classes and doing OS 
It is exceedingly difficult to do daily tasks on Linux which is why Mac is typically amazing 
SSH and VirtualBox in and out of Mac gives it the simultaneous versatility of UNIX and the smooth daily driver for writing essays and other typical tasks 
I would prefer VM Linux Mac over Windows and pure Linux dualboot 
I tried all of them and Mac is the best by far 
The issue is that Linux is meant to be barebones and used for VM but that comes at the cost of daily driving 
I have a desktop to run heavy workloads on Linux VM is need be but pretty much everything besides ML is doable on Mac CPU 
Well congrats 
You managed to resort to the classic cherry picking nonsense 
I encourage you to read the actual book to get a sense of MLK worldview 
Yeah obviously class unity really racial unity but I think that what you meant is part of that plan 
Why do you think fighting for policy and larger unity is somehow distinct 
Policy is the backbone of larger movements 
A movement without policy is a movement without goals 
It the exact meaningless feel good picnic strategy Occupy championed and look where that got them 
You have a tall nose 
People in Asian culture make a big deal about how pretty it is 
Not to mention you are very beautiful 
Your eyes cheeks and smile radiate gentleness 
It been a rough day for me but if this can cheer you up I would be very happy 
Did watch the video all the way through since I do read Korean but it seems like I can do most of the movement in this video 
Although I sure it would be nice to do manual JA someday just for backwards JA the speed is quite nice 
Also thing is probably just you did uncheck one of the suboptions for SK 
toggle every presses If not the exact order at least to the same effect 
Btw you do need Stick Keys 
Certain keyboards will let you JA without it 
Also I have found a demonstration in KMS but at least here we can chain Phalanx with SK which is a nice DPS boost 
You do think the primary economic solution to poor people is at the center of the Poor People Campaign 
What kind of fucking difference 
lol 
The Poor People Campaign was a poor people movement yes 
MLK had written and voiced his support for what he called Guaranteed Income which is what we know as UBI nowadays 
In his book Where Do We Go From Here Chaos or Community https MLK argued in for Guaranteed Income as a way to lift up the poor more effectively than minimum wage 
In short was one of the policies he was fighting for in that Poor People when he died a year later in 
Saying that he was fighting for UBI is like saying he was fighting for voting rights in on the March to Washington just because it was fighting for economic and civil rights for African Americans 
I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure the guaranteed income 
This took one take 
He also cut a BB gun pellet in two takes on MythBusters 
Considering he was killed the day he was supporting it I would say this one is okay 
You literally lying about half the contents of these sources 
We got a fucked up voting system being abused too 
What do you suggest to get things done then 
If half the country ignores democracy we in a fucking prisoner dilemma with a nice added taste of lobbying 
Mushroom game 
I did say anything about that 
is just objectively better 
Whatever one you go for is up to you 
is marginally better already 
As far as I can tell Masters in CS not SWE opens far more doors to Bachelor positions as well as positions that require Master and above 
SWE may be a good degree but it reminds me of a BA vs BS if that makes sense 
I ca back this up with data but I have a feeling employers do value SWE degree as much 
Knowing CS will let you learn SWE with ease 
I usually just rewatch things or listen to podcasts 
It feels weird to focus just on a show and ironically I start thinking about other work things and get stressed 
Maple is a good distraction 
Feel free to explain 
I have heard a single real argument on how FJG is better than UBI 
Welcome to information security 
Then by definition some Americans want to work with others for climate change 
It not so binary 
With enough political finesse we could work with China in controlling climate change and push human rights 
Right now we ca do either effectively given the economic dependency but addressing climate change and automation would eventually give American companies more leverage and market share to reject China 
Not to mention many Chinese do wish to work with Americans on climate change because it easy for them to push an America just wants to take control narrative 
I still do those things but also Grinding is easier than the stuff I need to do in life that requires far more brain power 
It so braindead and that honestly good 
Same about

No you could just use manual jump attack as KMS does 
This is ideal as it provides maximum control

You welcome If you want Reboot NW community here https 
We a lot more friendly here 
Yep 
Can confirm keys does work but it seems to depend upon the internal wiring of certain mechanical keyboards to be consistently possible 
DuckyOne as Static mentioned seems to be a good choice 
My Corsair keyboard can not do this as far as we can tell 
A few of us Reboot NWs got together to try out different keyboards and there were only that seemed to work as of now 
That being said Sticky Keys can still do everything you need 
Edit it CAN work but not as easy as the DuckyOne 
Was asking for flight information but I glad my post can be humored lol 
Ghost pretty much covered it 
I raise survivability to since we will get the Cygnus healing and damage reduction in the winter 
I ca speak to Dual Blade in detail but given her had Mirror Target Asura dmg tanking and two iframes he should be much much higher across the board beside mobbing 
Do mean to sound like an ass lol 
It just amazes me how much credit people give NL and Hero 
Night Walker mobbing lul 
Bossing at lower than NL 
DB bossing even lower at 
Lol 
Tamir was kind to call it misleading my friend

In addition people need to stop saying evolution 
Macroevolution and microevolution have very different evidences of varying strength and patterns

I actually like to see a therapist but I long given up 
A binary search tree 
Thinking back to the days people still spent plenty of money 
Whale economies were never a healthy design for any MMO and GMS walked straight into that willingly with Tyrants and SW and the old SF system 
Assuming no hackers is a big if but I would have loved Maple to do a Reboot trading limitations per day per week etc 
system from the 
Frankly that and no Kanna would have made alternate universe Maple a lot more intriguing 
It basically KMS except they got sucked into Tyrants blue stars 
Listening to music discord voice chat while I grind 
Guess that was a lie 
I have one question for you what part of any of this do you find fun or rewarding 
It not like Maple has tangible value lol 
As stupid as it is it would make a lot more sense to print fake dollars than hack in Maple 
From this post it does even seem like you trying to sell the account so what exactly are you doing 
of this game is grinding and the remaining does take much time 
I care but not enough 
Bug Type Faulty skill Using Dark Omen on Night Walker in the air 
jumping makes the skill effect appear on the ground regardless of ping 
Reproducibility Rate EDIT It seems Dark Omen attack speed is much slower than it was before 
If you vertical jump Omen will still appear in the air just much slower 
Effectively this means a double flash jump cast of Omen will no longer hit the air 
I watch myself grinding on Twitch 
Because they mastered the one and only element needed addictive game systems

I do have a consistent schedule typically so I used to farm hour days for like a week then stop farming until the next event 
Vice versa when I do have consistency then maybe hours a day or just a total of hours a week 
He is not 
Please read Matthew 
I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another woman commits adultery 
Instead of testing your spirits why not try reading the unchanging word of God first 
It can not be more clear 
You missing the gospel 
We are all sinners and not worthy of the kingdom of God 
Why did Jesus eat with sinners 
Why did he say to the woman who was to be stoned Go woman your sins are forgiven 
Let the one without sin be the first to stone her 
Not to mention the verse I put above specifically said except for sexual immorality 
OP is not an adulterer because his wife committed adultery and he chooses to remarry 
The Bible is explicit about this over and over again 
His divorce is legitimate in the eyes of the Lord and he is allowed to remarry 
As Paul mentions death is one way for a man or woman to be free from marriage 
But that is NOT the only way 
If you want to preach Jesus' teachings please learn it first 
EDIT This is the verse you refer to Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God 
Do not be deceived Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men a nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God 
that is what some of you were 
But you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our Corinthians Are you without sin 
I am certainly not without sin 
We all need repentance and the gift of God 
From your other comments you are sounding like a Pharisee I must be honest 
I encourage you to all of Scripture not just a few verses 
What are you talking about 
Matthew I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife for sexual and marries another woman commits adultery 
Not to mention Jesus said the only sin unable to be forgiven is that of blasphemy of the Holy Spirit 
He forgives us already 
Just a heads up funding a character to level is very hard on reboot 
It basically a Gollux pensalir and boss accessories away if you can get some decent nodes 
Not checking the source but maybe Sicillienne 
How is this relevant 
It is possible to extend psychology and behavioral studies to better understand human relationships 
Science is not as rigid as you think and our discovery of new truths often clarify and change our understanding of old truths 
What do they give 
Night walker because I saw a gameplay video with nice music 
Oh and backstep 
Probably next Tuesday 
There a massive problem of scale 
I am a researcher in evolutionary and genetic algorithms and they can not fully replicate biological evolution at the current state of the art 
Not least in part because we barely have an understanding of the human genome much less a complete mapping of active and recessive genomes 
The computational complexity required to flesh out biological evolution is immense 
At the same time the fossil record is not complete and is subject to a variety of abnormal geological influences 
Gravity as far as we can observe has followed much mathematical theory 
The theory of gravity is a set of rigorous mathematical constructs that have been observed and replicated 
The theory of evolution has not been able to be observed in its entirety and is far less rigorous than gravity 
By the sheer scale of the human genome you need immense amounts of time and computation space to even begin to craft a mathematical model that may accurately represent human evolution alone 
You ca possibly claim gravity is less understood than evolution 
I encourage you to dig into the quantum mechanics of it if you have a technical background 
It can get involved but please do not claim that evolution is a more rigorous theory 
Ah it must not be supported on mobile 
How can you tell they cheering

That being said I wish we had a stickied guide section 
I love to cover everything you just listed and although they not perfect I think there are more than enough guides for a lot of the issues you mentioned It a little tiring to post the same link over and over again 
This goes for other guide makers like MasteringGaming LeWaffles Smartbored etc 
It be very handy to have a place to pin these guides 
Go watch C Span videos over the last few decades 
Quint spark bat Omen and bind nodes total 
Kanna Hero DB NW AB DS off the top of my head 
That NW BA makes very little sense 
Am I reading it wrong or did he just do very different amounts of quintuples 
On the downside we ca just toggle on Dark Sight to turn off pet loot anymore 
What are your thoughts on universal basic income 
First you made my day amazing 
Second I think is good because it meets the standard musical note length of beats with the choo 
They said that wondroid will be back soon presumably around next February 
That a fantastic name 
Kudos 
It not THAT much of a damage loss especially for the majority of your gameplay time 
Up until endgame it not terribly noticeable 
You can still enjoy the game 
Many schools bunch electrical engineering and computer science together

Given the people on the Internet nowadays I say it more common than you think 
You sound like an absolute douchebag 
Yang explains his platform well and simple for the average American 
Underwear 
Not boxers not thightie blackies but like those boxer shaped tights 

Night Walker has equal or better mobbing than most of these classes if you play it well 
Surprisingly Blaster only has booster and MW 
Do play it though 
It honestly a shame 
Before Reboot I used to do CSS merching and the intermittent bot waves tanked prices to the point that any valuable scrolls a new player could be lucky and loot would be virtually worthless 
Before if you were a new player and found a lucky you could at least make a decent amount of its drops 
Are our discount events scaled appropriately 
I remember before stars we were only discounted on the base cost during safeguard 
It primarily came from a place of fact a long time ago because KMS players had different map rotations than we did 
In essence players would stay for slightly longer in one part of the map and made it seemed like mobs would rotate in spawn 
It was just a misleading observation because GMS players preferred relatively small maps even 
Immediately grab your HT earrings and start working on Gollux 
You roughly at the midgame portion of my guide now 
Cube emblem and secondary as well as the Gollux rings and SW accessories 
Same edit fixed itself shrug 
I do disagree with you 
I just do think it enough to warrant the higher star force cost 
I want Ultimate Dark Sight or a bigger shuriken themed skill for NW 
Bats are awesome but sometimes I wish I could use Shurrikane just for the sound effects lol 
Hackers that want spawn increase already have it and they abusing it far heavier than most people benefit 
A hacker can increase spawn for the biggest maps and loot the entire map instantly 
Our SF cost is higher and is not nearly as affected by discount events either 
For me NW or DB since they have incredible bossing sets 
Hero has a nice boss toolkit too but the class is overall too clunky for my tastes 
DB has more FAR more utility for bossing with iframes IED bursts and a shell effect during Asura apparently but it falls at mobbing 
It also has a nice burst every bind 
It also has ultimate dark sight which proves incredibly useful in Lotus 
NW has far better mobbing though with practically full map coverage in almost every map 
It has an extra life and some super stance 
But it does have the cheap iframe tanks 
So it requires far more mechanics and control because you have to dodge everything 
There is a HP shield that helps but it still not as tanky as DB 
NW bossing is more fluid than DB in many cases because perfect play makes NW never stop attacking even during repositioning 
If played well both are very mobile but NW is slightly more mobile with a larger up jump and backstep 
Honestly as a NW main I would play either class in a heartbeat 
They both excellent 
The biggest primary difference is Ultimate Dark Sight iframes for DB and mobbing fluidity for NW 
NW Bossing example ignore ugly asian man https NW Bossing example https DB Bossing example ignore purple HP bar https DB Bossing example https DB Mobbing https I do have a good video of NW mobbing at least not one that I can approve of lol 
If you need I can make one 
What the evidence for this 
Edit no need to downvote 
Genuinely curious lol 
He has the experience and understanding of leading groups of people through problems 
You ca run businesses without building coalitions naturally 
I argue it even more difficult than politics because the benefits and individual incentives are even more blurred 
Not to mention which other candidates actually have coalition building skills 
Given their decades in politics they have exactly done much 
Skills and political wit can be gained quickly 
I think you gatekeeping a bit and forgetting the forest for the trees 
Bernie has direction but Yang has vision and implementation 
His heart is in the right place but Yang has the mind and experience 
Please double check your flame comparison 
Arcane is level and each piece is roughly an additional stat extra depending on the combination of Tier Stat line you get 
That comes out to an extra stat not an extra 
Edit forgot shoulder With meso cost it debatable 
Arcane set is as difficult as people make it out to be compared to average replacement costs 
From memory Arcane is equal if not better around 
Overall either is fine of course 
This is the most beautiful thing to happen to me today 
I wish they could do Anxious Existence from the AI video 
Perhaps a lackluster example 
Something like buying a tote bag instead of using plastic or going organic just to reduce methane pollution 
Honestly ca think of better examples off the top of my head but I think the point is clear 
Most people are capable of focusing on so many issues so passtionately all the time 
And if they do that effect is relatively diminished 
That extends to media coverage protest movements and beyond 
The flip side of it is that people who do go vegan can often times be satisfied with just doing their part when what they doing is relatively insignificant 
Perhaps going vegan is difficult for you but I sure you can imagine the difficulties other vegans go through and how that pans out to other types of changes people make 
Top schools CMU GT Berkeley etc 
have far more than you mentioned 
Databases information security etc 
are all still valuable at Extracurricular stuff is super important too of course 
But I argue the theoretical foundations beyond the interview cookie cutter stuff helps you succeed later in in your career 
It the depth that the difference 
It not so black and white 
But it is true that personal change brings about minimal impact 
So much advertising room and dialogue is on personal change that we do change the industries and economies that would bring about systemic change at a broader scale 
There is only so much focus to go around 
A vegan diet may actually be detrimental if it takes the energy away from fighting for industrial change 
They from Labyrinth for Verus Hilla pretty fitting 
Frankly Hong Kong is an economic capital 
It influence economically and politically for the world is far larger than Kashmir 
As much as I think the people in Kashmir matter the world still runs on money 
If Hong Kong falls that has far larger consequences for international business and the resulting effects is far more widespread 
Business and capital drive our future far more than many realize

I not sure what you have against meritocracy As an Asian male who faces similar racial disparities with no chance at being recognized in a diversity hire this field is still relatively meritocratic

NBC News' Philadelphia officers injured as they respond to shooting https Officers took cover behind cars and blocked off surrounding streets as they were fired upon by the unidentified shooter 
Philadelphia police were shot at Wednesday afternoon after responding to a shooting incident in a North Philly neighborhood 
A large police presence responded to a shooting incident in a residential area of the Nicetown section of the city 
One male shooter was still inside a residence in what police described as an active situation 
Officers took cover behind cars and blocked off surrounding streets as they were fired upon by the unidentified shooter 
A Philadelphia Police Department spokesperson told NBC News that several officers were injured in the exchange and described the scene as an active and ongoing incident 
The department said in a statement that the injured officers were taken to Temple University hospital located just minutes away 
It unclear how many were hurt but NBC Philadelphia reported that at least five officers were shot 
A witness who lived close to the shooting told NBC Philadelphia that she heard a series of shots fired what felt like gunshots and could smell what seemed to be gunpowder before police arrived to the scene 
The unidentified woman told NBC Philadelphia that it felt like a war 
The nearby campus for Temple University Health Sciences Center is under lockdown as the situation unfolds 
SEPTA the city public transit provider reported that it will temporarily bypass Hunting Park Erie and Allegheny stations all located in the surrounding area of the shooting

Several PPD Officers have been injured 
Three police officers have been shot a federal law enforcement source told CNN 
The condition of officers is unknown the source said 
The officers are a part of the narcotics division according to the source 
Gripp said the shooting situation was active and ongoing 
Philadelphia police were first called to the scene for drug activity Police Capt 
Sekou Kinebrew told CNN affiliate KYW 
Video from a news helicopter showed more than police vehicles at the scene 
The video also showed an armored vehicle approaching an area where many police officers could be seen kneeling and crouching behind various cars with guns drawn

My company does allow teams to grow beyond people whether that for demos design reviews code Reviews stand ups or anything on that level 
Be prepared to communicate with them every day but a code review for people is almost never reasonable 
A demo to that scale is but a detailed technical review does work with people in a presentation setting lol 
You probably right 
Was likely an oversight on my part because this was made before stars 
What classes in particular would this affect do you think 
It honestly a bit difficult for me to compare attack and boss still cause it kinda depends on the level and star force now 
I believe they similar for high multiplier classes Maybe 
I likely leave them to be equivalent for most classes for now 
You right about the link skill discrepancy 
It such a nightmare since we have Jett Hayato and now Cygnus to contend with Kanna Mage and Thief now 
I doubt there a one size fits all solution anymore or even a binary situation unfortunately 
Too tired to defend lol 
Watch a video or something 
You can go to the BC settings and flip that 
I been told the mage link debuff is indeed solo 
Have personally verified of course 
I decided to remove the Hayato link 
It seems inconsequential now compared to Mage and Thief 
Have quite decided how important AB is now especially since it varies between burst classes now 
Classes without BD are pretty much ignoring AB 
I have to reorder the list 
I still consider Resistance relatively high 
In Lucid onwards its utility and potential damage output in seconds is likely to Trump damage 
It makes a lot of sense in the majority of boss fights especially Darknell BM and HLotus 
Thanks 
I update the guide 
Link skills have now been updated https Somehow the previous iteration was recorded properly 
My bad 
EDIT Give me a few hours to reorder list pls

Its effects make its effective CD anyway even ignoring spear 
I sorry to hear that Kisara Come back soon 
Considering was a national emergency that point seems moot 
The fire was in NYC and yet the entire country went to war 
That is the reality of our country 
We have national interests above state interests at times 
What you saying is incorrect but is still missing the point 
Federal taxes 
Not sure if it completely theory but Georgia Tech has a good online Masters program 
Most of the classes are heavily theoretical 
Nothing is ever a guarantee with Nexon support unfortunately 
I been screwed by them before too 
But it still stands that non streamers have gotten stuff back too 
It just a fact 
Spreading this favoritism stuff regards to item is just damaging to people who wo even bother because they not streamers 
Watch the clip please 
It happened in under frames 
Also since I being brought up so much here I just like to point out that I not the only one to receive this kind of treatment 
many normal people have gotten Superior Gollux stuff back amongst accidental sell extract and drop 
As far as I aware Arcane has not received the same treatment 
This circle jerk is misleading at best 
I love for OP friend to get it back but have got ta stop with this favoritism stuff on every post about a lost item 
It just not true 
As far as Ace has said on a stream it seems to be just minor changes so presumably just some number tweaks 
At least nothing on the scale of Kanna 
More importantly rings do have flames 
Ever heard of an absence 
Class is important but there is rarely ever a class you ca make up 
She already said she does have a bus 
Not everyone can afford a commuting Lyft both ways especially in the South 
Given she needs a car to get to class with no bus available I say her Lyft cost could be at least each way 
So no must missed the part about no bus 
A lot of college students are far from family and friends 
How much do you think one class actually matters 
Lol

I a professional in large scale networking and cyber security 
What do I know about information security and how that can screw with a person entire finances banking job family and everything else in their life 
Get out of your Maple bubble 
Someone just stole the personal information of potentially hundreds of people and you talking about a game 
They had an Excel sheet at MapleFest where you input your email and name to the Nexon account amongst other information As Zhong said someone apparently took a picture of a large part of that sheet 
That fucking ridiculous that someone was allowed to do that 
That has real life consequences REAL fast much larger than this game 
Blaze Wizard 
do max 
Crit damage crit rate damage attack 
I was expecting a Mihile or BT reference lol 
You just have gotten to fifth job yet 
That was their revamp 
I heard it helps if you bind immediately after she uses a skill instead of when she still flying around 
It a breath of fresh air 
Just confirmed no timeframe 
My guess is winter or exactly February like every other year 
Although given how long Dev sprints last maybe even September 
For fucks sake people 
Which is more important 
The fact that Nexon leaked at least a hundred players' personal info or the fact that this clip is from a dude who botted 
Big picture please EDIT We all know Zhong botted 
This is clearly not the point of the damn post 
Get over it 
The danger is having so many personal information all in ONE PLACE being verifiably grouped 
That the danger 
I perfectly aware people give out names and emails and the other information given all the time 
The potential scale and is the real danger 
I do have time to give a full security lecture 
my memory serves me well there were other more pieces of information there too 
I am being deliberately vague to limit the security WHAT THIS MEANS Okay it seems there are still people who do understand this 
your full name and email well as some of the other information that was put at the MapleFest whoever took the photo s and all who access to it WITH OR WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE can now potentially and readily endanger everyone in the following ways Phish everyone who you ever emailed texted or called 
They can pretend to be you and do untold amounts of damage to your life and family and everything you hold dear Infiltrate every account across any service without that you used the email in 
That over of people and ALL your banking and financial information including bank account and routing numbers readily stealing all your money and transferring to anonymous accounts and causing you to lose potentially tens of thousands of dollars before your bank notices ALL your private conversations including your job applications with all that delicious goldmine of information like your physical addresses phone numbers ID date of birth and literally everything ALL your insurance policies travel iteneraries tax forms and literally anything and everything in your email Remember how every time you forget your password a reset goes through to your email 
Yeah 
That the only line of security there 
WHAT TO DO Enable two factor authentication on as many accounts as you possibly can ESPECIALLY YOUR EMAIL 
You can enable it in your Gmail here https and Outlook here https 
Make sure to LOG OUT of all your Gmail accounts by going to the bottom of your inbox and clicking details https If possible try to find as many options for as many important accounts as possible 
That includes but is not limited to your work email college account and financial portal tuition portal 
LinkedIn social media Amazon Netflix any court or government accounts federal services account 
USPS UPS etc 
and more 
Keep a close eye on your banking and email over the next few years 
Set up spending alerts and call your bank if you need help 
Someone I knew was compromised a number of years ago 
That person almost lost over in wages and was close to being falsely accused of white collar crime because of ID theft 
Luckily it was a large scale leak so things were taken care of after many months of effort 
This could very well happen to you 
Just because it mushroom game does mean an ID theft is any less deadly 
I ca believe they actually let someone take pictures of the sheets 
Not doing a Google Form is already bad but to have lax physical oversight and security too 
photo s need to be removed as soon as possible from all platforms before they too widely distributed

As one of the players almost done with dailies this is becoming more and more true 
People brush over the events but they a nice way to spend time for fun 
I just make guides that cover everything so a link is all I need 
I do expect anyone I help to stick along for more than half a year though 
Just kinda go with the mindset that I can help and make your life a little better then I will 
Does matter if it only for half a year 
Come find me on stream today in an hour I take you 
What your IGN 
Does it work in Hilla and Will 
Enjoy your NW 
It wo be easy 
https 
They come back every three months 
There a sub option under sticky keys that turn it on if you hold them together or multiple times 
Just turn it off 
But we got a PQ 
Then you be at so yeah 
Although I not sure if Kinesis is actually capable of hitting it at all just from their particular skill set 
That seems to be the case 
Pathfinder is likely to have the same cap 
If anyone has any concrete numbers though feel free to share 
As far as I can tell it makes no difference 
Oh does it not 
Then frankly I not sure lol 
Kinesis does get any increase from and as the other user explains Pathfinder is about the same 
That the plan 
I been against this meta for years very vocally but I guess there not much left to do 
Can you imagine if they fix it when I actually hit tho lol 
It does change your actual attack speed 
Oh no is from V matrix 
No problem 
No worries 
You forgetting dSI and green pot which brings it down to with AS 
is never a good number as Kinesis will show you 
It either or 
So you might as well use another IA 
Bosses and monster collection 
Still leeching a Kanna anyway 
Not Attack Speed 
You cap at without party which is pointless 
The recommended is boss buff and crit 
You can find other classes here https will let you keep it up with plenty of time to recast 
For more info read the corresponding tab ty 
I in the same boat 
It still has gotten fixed 
I just gave up frankly 
Support has been helpful at all 
This is the kind of content I come here for 
For a few more years 
Wow had no idea this was happening 
Thanks for bringing it up 
No worries 
Sorry if I came off pretty angry lol 
We being paid NX a month 
What a fantastic bribe 
I ca speak for the others but here my two cents I been playing this game for it entire duration and have been very active on this subreddit since the beginning of Reboot 
I think anyone who been on this sub knows I comment on almost everything 
I do comment on false bans very much because there literally no way I can tell whether they crying wolf or actual false bans 
I been in contact with both of those kinds of people some of whom have literally told me yeah I just trying my luck but I actually did hack lol 
I only delete comments on YouTube if they irrelevant or meant to be toxic 
Not to mention if you actually watch my streams you know I weigh in on these issues daily 
Hell I still shit on Nexon all the time 
And even if there was a way for me to weigh in with full knowledge that each of these people were falsely banned what should I say 
My words have no impact on their bans 
At the end of the day you have no idea how much I work and try to leverage my position as a player closer to Nexon to get them to fix specific bugs and issues 
I even made a large Google Doc https with a list of issues for Ghiblee months ago 
Just because we get NX from Nexon does mean they give us any additional way to change the game 
I put more thousands of hours trying to help this ungrateful subreddit and work with Nexon than I have into my own account 
If you want to accuse me of not working to solve the problems of this game I https Do https Know https Who https You https Talking https About https 
That is true 
Although to be further pedantic given that it C a memory leak may also be a proper way to describe it 
Cascading pointer references may cause the UI call to not properly display as it is still tied to the previous leaked pointer 
An example of this could be a node based structure where the node is lost but internal components of the node is still referenced 
A leak would only gather more and more memory if it was constantly referenced so it may not be immediately obvious and cause memory shortage 
As the game crashes quickly after a bad reference due to outdated components can be an explanation too 
I mean what do you want her to say exactly 
We already know she ca make any real development decisions 
It called an investment 
By your logic just shut down the game lol 
It should be 
If it is just let me know 
Just updated for Pathfinder 
Just a heads up there Link Skills on the bottom of that too 
It much better than Ayumilove 
Your in game key setting please Also go to set up sticky keys too 
I appreciate you remembering my work 
But I got ta be honest getting pinged on a Friday getting off work with the first words being badges wondroid hearts gives me a mild scare lol 
Maybe a link to the doc would be helpful 
Yet Yang can work with an actual bipartisan Congress given his bilateral support 
That has been a bug for many years albeit not to this scale 
It would take some time to explain technically so suffice it to say server load can affect it but more mobs is almost certainly not the direct cause 
That being said less channels more mobs multiplied by more players can all do this 
Kishin mules are no exception unfortunately 
Surprisingly Fury Totem would be less strain on the server mildly relative to a Kanna mule because of it would not need to maintain one extra TCP connection 
Ultimately these are questions we need data to answer and Nexon does not or can not tell us 
Channels have been hard crashing for a multitude of other reasons 
I sincerely doubt Kishin is one of them 
It does increase server cost and load more for sure 
But the overall performance seems dictated by other factors like player count 
Some players still ca get any rewards cause the link is just bugged 
Keyboard setting ss pls 
Where do you get this 
With meso reduction due to level and meso buffs I can still do generally 
x Lv 
It almost like a company can do good bad 
It a lot more common nowadays thankfully 
Since I lost and recovered my earrings last year I counted about cases to my friends recovering anything from superior rings to tyrant gloves 
They all pretty low profile intentionally 
It a good trend 
Personally having to think about how to type Korean for a Captcha is the only thing stopping me 
It does 
Press an arrow before you pick it up 
I doing that right now 
Why would I pay to buy a car the insurance parking gas and all that when everything else is just cheaper 
https 
Permanent enrage is nice 
It fine 
But please never ever buy MCCs 
Welcome to software engineering 

Confirmed bugged 
Might just be too many bags for one pet sometimes 
They fixed it but who knows 
If you have less than three pets try looting every or less 
Is that confirmed 
I thought we were the only servers with hard cap 
Thanks for linking 
KMS does it 
I suggest looking at their videos 
Hard cap is with DSi and green 
You can jump attack manually 
Sticky Keys is ONLY for hard cap 
Can you also post Lab server memes 
For most new players I think it actually a larger difference than badges 

With Mercedes legion it a much shorter downtime surprisingly 
Shadow bite has CD servant has downtime and phalanx has about 
NW only needs to make amazing rates at Arcana which is not too difficult 
One good DMT and SF event is all you need 
I find it kinda funny how most people think NW is only good funded but NL is even harder unfunded haha 
NW is not easy to play I give you that 
But the simple jump attack aside it objectively better on everything now 

I was once also weak boi 
Keep in mind I played this class when it was bugged weak and objectively horrible haha 
Minor correction but JMS also has it 
Quintuple spark Omen bite stationary shadow partner spear and phalanx 
skills 
If you ca mob with night Walker you doing it wrong 
I not sure about burst anymore 
Spread nerf was hard 
Easy and it depends on how much you want to be efficient 
The one to three hours is a lot 
You make slower progress in the beginning but you go faster and faster as those dailies get faster 
Badges are unfortunate but you can clear all the content without them so do worry 
I gon na start leeching mine soon 
Honestly it sucks but at least if you leech you be prepared for any future endgame areas 
Any information on what the cygnus links will be 
It seems to still be timegated 
Just buys one day of dailies 
MW https Cygnus https Demon https 
MW https Cygnus https Demon https 
New V Skills and Explorer Links apparently https Not mine 
EDIT Cashew Cannoneer Archers Crit rate Monster Collection chance increase 
I did say it was defendable 
I said it was horrible but you should still be civil 
You argued with the guy that did like how someone cursed at the CM 
So I figured your intent is pretty clear 
Also merging code is one of the hardest things to do especially in And frankly Nexon does pay very well lol 
No way they paying six figures to most of their engineers 
I actually considered the position and Glassdoor is not happy with it 
This patch is horrible 
I say it again they doing a terrible job 
Civility does mean you tolerate the performance 
It just a basic standard of communication in my opinion 
EDIT By the way I not attacking you 
Just explaining some pretty reasonable conclusions 
You right I am a computer scientist 
That why to the best of my knowledge as a customer I try to provide suggestions to the Nexon team about how they can improve their development pipeline 
Thank you for sprinkling some positivity here 
We need it 
It seems like you got downvoted for supporting cursing and rude behavior towards a CM who does really have any control over bugs 
I think they did an absolutely horrible job this patch but I do think that gives me a free pass to be rude 
My class was broken for over months to an even greater degree than Kanna 
Still did curse out Nexon lol 
I complain just civilly 
No 
How common is shogi 
Is it a niche thing for otaku or actually common 
I more concerned about midgame players who do have that many sources of attack 
This would create a big imbalance in that case no 
I understand this is more for overall funding so it a good model as is 
I just think it may be relatively misleading because passives do completely make up for the weapon gap given the larger amount of different classes with same weapons now 
Still excellent work 
Maple Fest 
How would you account for the disparity in base attack on weapons 
Would the multipliers be a way to account for that 
https 
Achoo 
Bless you too 
What else do you want 
Lol 
Exact dates months into the future 
It not settling 
It just a confirmation 
I all for advocating for events but there are specifics we just can not force 
Not trying to insult you but we have to make reasonable demands 
It clearly not for this summer since we already got so much planned so a promise is all we get 
That what elixirs are for 
They displayed increased drop rate for pink bean accessory as a point 
Easy BiS secondary probably would be a bigger deal 
Time to stop and zip the bag 
Wondroid is confirmed to return 
Likely someone is still crashing channels to dupe https hours of server crashes is not natural 
Nexon crappy servers crash but not to this repeated extent 
When they do crash they crash for long periods of time not increments 
Likely still people duping https Servers do typically crash like this for hours continuously 
They encourage heavy multi clients so you can divide those numbers by four 
Kanna skill that increases spawn 
Do worry about it 
For your equips https Levels https Levels without Kishin https Inner Ability https Should be enough to get you started 
Press an arrow key to unstick your key 
With Nexon it might be important to specify badges 
This is the creamy playlist I talking about https 
Lol if you refuse to read his specific references to me after I pointed it out twice then so be it 
Not gon na waste time convincing someone who does even want to see facts 
Most people do have four set Arcane and have farmed in a year 

And Meister Cube 
Thanks 
He a nice artist 
It does quite feel as chillhop or future bass as Spotify puts it though 
The Arcane thing was referring to me 
As far as toxic goes I do know how to explain to you 
It a pretty clear tone 
As far as an external server is concerned they would show as the same IP 
It virtually indistinguishable unless AWS got ahold of their local NAT table 
It is 
respawn and mob increase 
I been on JMS to confirm this 
The skill descriptions for their new Kishin and our Fury Totem is the same 
Guess I smoking screenshots and facts 
Lol 
Read his last paragraph lol 
Bringing up my work personal progression and schedule is personal 
Star Force having higher prices have been around for many years even before Reboot came out 
It just was obvious since we did have stars 
I suppose if you saying that it not significant before then that true 
After June their Kishin will be exactly the same as ours 
Considering the Fury Totem is a GMS exclusive feature it not that farfetched 
No reason to make it personal and toxic first of all 
I simply bringing up a point 
Second their Kishin was and now it 
That the only major difference 
The spawn amount was the same as far as JMS players have told me 
It does account for the nearly difference in SF costs 
I did say anything about MSEA 
If you want to complain about MSEA be my guest 
As a GMS Reboot player I have a place to ask about why things are the way they are 
If you do like it that fine 
In an ideal world that would be nice 
Unfortunately that does seem likely 
That is an issue which is why I pointing out the issue first and foremost 
The problem is such a divide between GMS Reboot and other regions' Reboot servers' meso values is not even in the discussion much less at a tweaking stage 
Again I want to point out JMS 
They have a Reboot server and they make about as much as we do yet they have half the rates 
KMS is the only server that exists and I argue it a horrible model to compare for with GMS since they have significantly less content than we do 
Take a look at JMS 
They also have our soon to be nerfed Kishin and they have both Reboot and 
Their server has a healthy economy comparable to KMS and they make about as much rates as we will be making in days 
Yet we still will have nearly double the costs 
And here in lies the problem 
As you pointed out it is the most logical step to take and I would further point out that it not very difficult to implement such a reduction 
For example there could be a permanent reduction for Reboot 
I am simply asking if or why this issue is not being addressed properly 
It is entirely possible for two separate cost to exist in Reboot and 
One does not have to exist at the cost of the other 
I want to be clear this was the list of reasons I been given from various conversations streams and interactions with Nexon employees and many people from the community 
I think you missing my point I do believe GMS should have these higher star force rates at all but that it would make more sense for Reboot than for normal servers due to the circulation 
This is clear when you examine the Auction House prices in GMS JMS and KMS 
I used JMS as the example because they have the closest gear setup to what we have with a vastly different economy 
The Reboots are soon to be remarkably similar and yet we have this gap 
It is since the StarForce costs are nearly twice as high as other regions 
At this point even JMS with Kanna has the lower rates 

Not everybody wants to play that game 
And its reward system was very buggy 
I have gotten any rewards up to today lol 
TwEnTy SeVeN dAyS 
There was a post last year about a grandma playing with her grandson who quit 
It does 
I like what you said but there no need to bring his religion into this 
I Christian and I probably would said the same thing to such ignorance if I am as quick witted 
As someone who joined Reboot in the beginning with this in mind thanks for this post 
It a breath of fresh air 
Night walker because backstep 
Based on what Ace said if we get more playrs like in Black we get channels back 
Who does main Jett 
And the night walker bats 
That Lachelein theme 
The days leveling and waiting for Lachelein to come out 
I never been so motivated to play cause the game felt so uncharacteristically fresh after years of relatively meaningless content 
The node system was such a breath of fresh air as much as we take it for granted now 
Well thank you 
Check the Google translate English of first link 
Should be enough of a translation 
If you speak Japanese the Haku screenshots small and large Haku in second roughly says so according to translation 
I will double check soon just in case 
Lol does it matter 
The set effects and transfer hammer makes it worth cubing to epic 
Ah my bad 

Sounds like they just doing their job 
from YouTube Community tab easier to work with JMS Kanna to translate 
Here is summary JMS LEAKED Patch Notes are out unofficial http Japanese Skill Descriptions of with Chinese captions https EDIT Vanquisher bind is now Hyper Foot bind is 
Previous both were EDIT Teleport is much shorter 
No information found about delay or cast time 
Random teleport only in towns while fields only have cardinal directions 
EDIT Only barriers at a time 
Pink barrier damage reduction presumably not to boss attacks 
Blue barrier remains the same the new version of the old purple boss barrier but it has some mobbing utility because it now damage 
boss damage boss hyper skill may still be bugged in GMS It seems there are Hyper Skills meant to reduce CD on barriers 
If taken Pink barrier is and blue is 
EDIT For MSEA players and JMS players with stackable Kishin this change removes stacking and makes Kishin equal to GMS post nerf Kishin respawn time same mob increase JMS Kishin will be like GMS post nerf kishin 
Old JMS spawn rates depending on stacks seconds between spawns 
New Kishin no stacking 
EDIT Overall many new attack skills and it seems Kanna is significantly buffed 
Mana cap increase is unknown 
EDIT Haku healing is now Kanna only 
But Magic Attack buff remains to party 
Kanna also benefits from all stats on Haku fan now big buff 
EDIT Tengu CD 
JMS Kishin will be like GMS post nerf kishin 
Old JMS spawn rates depending on stacks seconds between spawns 
New Kishin no stacking 
What are some good ways to end conversations 
Nodes are fifth job items for damage boost 
It a good plan you have 
Just level to and get fifth job 
It be much easier 
https In case you have seen this 
Switch to pensalir and try for normal gollux 
You able to do it but it will take some time with monster Park potions 
If you can afford the gollux potions and some nodes you can kill the left shoulder right side and snipe Hard Gollux for minutes to try and get Reinforced as well 
It way too early for PNO in my opinion because you can just use Gollux 
Hayato shoulder and Ayame belt is nice but you have much more efficient ways to spend that time until at least the end of midgame when you get or prepare to get CRA 
F 
Look at the comments in the video 
It almost like they were typed by people 
It not enough to compensate if that what you saying 
BPot is really really good 
Teleport is great in phase 
Lol if you copy pasting it so much why not just remove the last paragraph 
They were advertising porn links 
Any mobile class with map coverage 
Night Walker too 
And our mobbing is better 
I not sure you understand what the term bad actors means 
Some people just do enjoy merching and would rather just grind without worrying about both and the market Actor network theory is a whole different thing 
Care to clarify then 
It half of that if you above 
There is a regression chart somewhere on the sub 
They should at least make the cannonball visible for people who turned up transparency 
For the middle cannon getting hit is practically a death sentence in flag because you just get knocked down a whole 
The stun times are far too long especially if you just spam to troll the people stuck at the bottom 
It almost RNG in some situations 
Just because it possible to get around it with excellent ping does mean it is very overpowered 
I popped A at various times for a ball and never has it blocked 
It far too reliant on ping 
Just change it out before you go in lol 
We can move long distances if we need to 
The backstep is for subtle movement in Lucid and lotus for example 
Big is sometimes a disadvantsge 
Kek 
Where did they say this 
Ah that fair 
I edit the pinned 
You welcome 
As far as I can tell even in KMS normal servers with iCOG and attack value has only deflated to stat at the most 
For Reboot that deflation seems to limit to the values I listed in the conversion slide 
This was based on some of their biggest whales like Shinhaejo and the screaming dude 
And thanks will do 
Had to get on the big screen to write this response haha 
Good suggestions I put them in on the next version hopefully next year 
That being said here some clarifications I agree 
I had to be a bit liberal here because it was also for Legion grinding but in hindsight Rare is honestly not bad for most classes 
I put those values as recommended values for solo progression as I assumed anyone who would rush through this stage is getting carried 
The different stages is obviously a thing 
For me I considered the difficult of the boss the average stat needed to clear as well as the time required to get there 
Lategame Endgame is distinct due to the nature whereas Midgame Lategame is also distinct as there a spike in difficulty with and Normal Lucid 
No one person will be always fully in one stage or another it more just a general guideline 
If anyone has more opinions on this I glad to hear it 
For simplicity sake in the guide I just thought this would be a good organizational scheme because I could think of anything better to explain to the average player succinctly 
I tried to list either the equips or the level range for the sections as a general rule but yeah I could be more explicit here certainly 
Technically covered the base with the flame conversion slide but you right 
That was my oversight along with the lack of mention on for shoulder 
I include it in the next version 
I am not wavering on the recommendation though because that is a solid spot to stop 
Keep in mind once the midgame stage is finished players should be ready for Lotus and Damien parties 
I deliberately avoided recommending the order of and simply listed a benchmark 
star would be nice but it far too expensive whereas is not really that bad 
It may not be a major step up from but it not particularly expensive either 
In addition it would help with some of the SF maps at that stage with the additional damage change from KMS 
I took the conversion rate with the endgame in mind at theoretic all and the like 
It similar to how we would compare IA not at legion but 
That is intentional 
The counterargument of being entirely precise about the conversion at every stage of the game is not particularly poignant because it basically only at the endgame that these tweaks are really so important 
In other words stat is nothing until the endgame 
I strongly disagree with the estimate 
In my calculations it appears to be more along the lines of for the endgame 
You are right I did mention only flat stat for due to the variations 
I assumed people would be smart enough to do the conversion themselves because I just ca point out every possible variation 
I can try to make that more explicit but there reaches that point of I ca handhold anymore imo 
I completely disagree 
Perhaps I could be more explicit but the set effects are not simple to compare 
IED Boss and even Critical Dmg vary heavily on their effectiveness 
However if you dig into the individual piece comparisons the stat comparison and attack comparison is big enough of a difference that it clear the set effects do contribute enough to the decision 
This is a regression problem with at least dimensions if not more lol 
I not even sure I could build a neural network capable of really calculating that 
If you want to look deeper feel free to reference the first version spreadsheet from a year ago 
It has been updated lately but you get the general idea from the second tab 
https It not simply a lack of research but an impossible question to answer hence the need for the heuristic estimation 
I took into account the lower and upper bound of the figures I could 
Crit damage FD Boss etc 
and made calculations that way 
Now if anyone wants to debate that slide and present well presented numerical arguments for specific situations please do 
As it is the attack on is just too significant if you examine the sheet 
Even for high base matt mages it like half a weapon and even more for higher multiplier classes like thieves 
Not to mention the SW higher potential tier and difficulty of actually even the dark boss set much less where it actually remotely comparable 
I hope that answers this part 
If anyone wants to compute the numbers for each class under theoretical situations please do 
But as it is the staggering difference in attack is significant enough for Reboot 
In normal servers with attack scrolls lessening the effect it is likely different 
This was a difficult section to do and a lot of it had to be intuitively estimated 
That does mean it wrong or the math is incorrect it just means its harder to derive 
By am I ignoring the set effect it just insignificant in the eyes of Gollux attack 
It math like this that makes me wish never existed but nevertheless it has to be done 
Frankly I still do understand the mathematics behind all classes WSE 
They all vary decidedly with the class' passives and individual attack patterns since V Matrix has IED as well as well as party composition 
It a problem with decidedly high difficulty which is why I included the WSE recommender Jeff the Berkeley math dude created 
Perhaps it a topic I can explore in a separate video 
I have genuinely tried to tackle it before but even for my own class it a hell of a problem to tackle 
You know what I mean if you look into it basically any problem directly messing with the damage formula in this game is just a mathematical nightmare especially when you try to generalize to classes that are constantly in those departments 
That being said I will likely look at the bossing party composition meta and try to create a video around that 
Among which will be WSE optimized scenarios like barriers domain bene boss rush potions whetstones etc 
Dynamic situations like that are very difficult if not impossible to calculate much less put into a generalized video 
If I could do it I would 
Even just to explain the parameters of the problem would take me minutes to be thorough Hopefully that cleared things up 
And yes MapleFest was fun thank you for asking 
I appreciate your input 
Woah my first gold and on my cake day too 
O Thank you haha 
Thank you 
I just a mere mortal though 
I mean Ranmaru 
Perm mastema pet emblem mp nx set Alicia Android arcana spirit damage skin and fairy heart 
For reference I got there with my friend at and we were and in line 
The line was only long until like or 
About people shamelessly cut in front of us which was rather ungraceful but that how it was 
The Rock Spirit was very limited which was unfortunate but everything besides the actual quantity was widely known on IG and Facebook so I not sure what OP meant by secret hidden information 
It was also on their Facebook 
Someone sent me a screenshot which was how I found out 
There are some clips I shot 
Uploading them now 
A few seconds of new Kanna skill in the works as well as the new content development teaser 
Holy shit 
Spear was bugged for that much 
How did they even test without dummy 
Lol good point 
I could play any class less fluid than Night Walker 
What if you wanted to swap to decent hs at the end 
To 
With burning and it not hard to do it in an hour 
Although that assumes Kishin with the optimal conditions 
A fix to Dominion to make it more fluid and easy to cast like Cadena or Zero 
More shuriken themed attacks 
We have a lot of bats already haha 
Protect the kids 
Just make runes spawn more often 
Please refer to my inner abilities video Nox 
There a spreadsheet with the link skills 
Just a minor correction it not the stars that make the badge op just the pot 
The stars are negligible since they do not give attack 
The pots are big but I estimate under FD combined which is a disadvantage but possible to overcome for all clearable content 
Still I wish they bring them back regularly 
You guys have job change in exchange 
Cygnus has the base stat and att for its shitty link 
Resistance link is very good and basically everyone else has something 
Unfortunately there does seem to be many other long series YouTubers 
I would become one nothing to start a series about lol There is Daboki but he has uploaded a continuation in ages 
And of course the infamous Maple Kombat series but that not really MapleStory 
Most things are friendly now besides a few items being once in a lifetime the old worries from Maple are generally gone 
Besides DCing and all that lul 
It not very difficult to get to by and certainly by 
Nevertheless does change the major line of reasoning 
New version planned for release after Maple Fest 
Spear has nearly uptime and Servant is FD 
Also keep in mind it far easier for a bat to two shot than it is for Mark just cause of the higher base 
I argue that between the lower CD on Bite and its synergy with it well compensates for Scroll and Shurrikane 
Omen is simply superior to Scroll since we can cast it while moving almost every 
Also keep in mind that in a denser map each spear is a mobbing attack in and of itself further stacked by bats bouncing back and forth between the same mobs 
Oh by the way Bite gives FD so it not like we short on damage p The argument that NW is inferior at lower funding is exactly founded since our skills still hit harder at lower funding 
If anything NL is only comparable at higher funding with one shot mark 
Also we have much better mobility in general 
We have dark Omen a servant summon spear phalanx and shadow bite 
Bite is far far better than sudden raid due to the extra bats and Spears 
Reboot is the most populated just a heads up 
NL or Marksman for crit rate Jett hayato or shade for crit damage 
Mercedes for skill cool down reduction 
Phantom for meso 
I burn a mihile 
Pick up a Jr 
Boogie familiar from perion 
It recovers mp at a nice rate 

It actionable 
If it in writing there a clear case of illegal discrimination here 
I would find a lawyer as soon as you able and take it to court 
It ridiculous and unacceptable 
If you would be so kind Would love to have that as channel https 
Thank you 
That great 
I would love to know more as well 
My research is a public it just a bit new so we hesitant to publish right now 
We have considered spiking yet although I not really sure exactly what that means 
We mostly working with the genome and getting a good overall structure first 
We may have considered it in the very beginning but that was before most of the code was written so who knows 
If I can understand it better maybe I can bring it up 
If you have the time I love to be educated on this 
Considering your assumption is incorrect I say it takes a lot more than that 
It is very possible to accidently include that 
I could see how it seems intentional if you just taken but that just the difference in expertise 
Or if someone on Reddit with limited or no knowledge of software engineering likes to think Nexon is out to ruin their player retention for nothing more than a pet 
Nexon needs some significant improvement but they not out to us whatever that means 
Lol 
Hm 
Try this https 
Can you elaborate more 
I have looked into it in detail yet 
Fixed thanks 
This project is actually a joint venture by mostly undergraduate and graduate students led by a few 
They came up with the idea but much of the implementation and advancement is done by undergrads 
There a lot of learning as you go 
I been with the subteam for almost half a year and I still somewhat lost 
It certainly helps to have a foundational understanding of ML and more specifically deep learning but there are many who learn on the way 
For some with less or none ML exposure they can still work on the programming aspects and consult the more experienced people as they run into software engineering challenges 

NEAT is a good GA that aims to create a similar result and may have been one of the original inspirations for our project I forget 
I not too familiar with the implementation but one key difference is likely in our usage of Cartesian Genetic Programming 
CGP is more efficient due to node reusage and likely more genetically poignant because it can explore the search space faster 
Since it a hyperparameter optimization it more about finding the right combinations of in our case neural network layers and the numbers of nodes hidden layers and how they should be interconnected 
Correct me if I wrong but what you suggesting is already inherently accounted for by avoiding overfitting which is a pretty standard challenge that any ML team tackles 
I like to not get into too much detail haha 
I only one of the contributors to the project so I not sure how much of it is would rather be kept more under wraps 
It not NDA or anything but just in case 
Essentially we a team of a larger project team that focused on using genetic algorithms and multiple objectives to generate algorithms 
For us we recently started to use CGP with some new design adjustments 
So far it has broke any state of the art but that likely due to a lack of diverse primitives since we still building up the foundational code and testing the system 
Once the system is fully established and hopefully proven to be better than or equivalent to problems beyond introductory datasets then we can explore more specific primitives to build up the genome along with more advanced mutation and mating properties 
I actually working on that right now and it very interesting 
There are many many directions with which hyperparameters can try to be optimized including evolutionary algorithms Cartesian genetic programming DENSER and so much more 
The AutoML research sector is growing and can prove very useful for problems without optimal solutions or custom preprocessed data 
While existing problems like MNIST or may have optimized models with specialized data batches designed by humans unoptimized problems can be greatly tackled already with AutoML 
Without going into specifics the dream for our research is to find optimal models without domain optimal knowledge or special human tweaking 
Rip the guy then 
Gollux type flames weaker stats 
Yes 
No clue 
If the optimal party maxed out theoretical cap for Reboot it maybe possible in minutes I doubt it 
and Arcane may barely do it but 
But most likely after another round of V buffs or something big 
Example TMS equip video https They have triple prime line cubes cubes that only give prime lines attack overall ATT Mu Gong buff soul FD familiars and so much attack that a NL can be stat and max range 
They have flames on all items though so stat is worth a lot there 
They also invented every broken item in GMS right now like BoD Lucid Earrings etc 
They have Gollux SW and all that 
And probably a lot more I missing here 
Edit fixed 
EDIT Confirmed it was a bug 
This is first real clear 
It seems there are two parts to Phase and you need to clear both the white and black bodies otherwise the party will get separated 
Most of the party finished their white body phase and got teleported to the victory room with no drops while one guy was lagging behind to finish the black body all by himself 
Ultimately was a full clear 
They currently trying again at midnight TMS time or in hours from now 
EDIT Second try might be tomorrow EDIT NL Perspective https EDIT fixed Example TMS Equip Video keep in mind they have triple prime line cubes 
Note the magic attack overall 
The NX items also gives stat https EDIT Mu Gong Soul they using https EDIT Apparently TMS Mu Gong is ATT for 
So cute love the so much

sorry if it strange 
Night walkers in EU lol 
Would you be able to release the SQL files too 
There are plenty of excellent cosmetics in recent years 
If I had money I love to spend it all on the new cute pets and buy skills for them not to mention the nice themed sets 
Late to the party but would you make one with

Throwing in Zero as well 
Shadow Servant FD Omen and individual spears 
In some maps even Phalanx 
Am updating this in a month or two

Good points 
For point though I suspect we see an explanation and allusion to that with Gerald 
It can depend heavily on what you mean by the point 
I had to create some videos above one hour long simply because the point is not always so easy 
If someone asks for BiS gear you could easily point them to technical BiS and give no context of how to get there 
Sure it gets to the point but it does really help 
If text provides context then it still be a huge block anyway 
It faster in minimizing the search space 
There are many outdated guides out there by definition 
Reddit is a great place to build context Youtube for completeness and reference and Twitch for specific questions 
A lot of the other games can be played in short bursts especially thinking about League 
MapleStory is more something you sit down and really invest in 
Check back in July and see if it changes 
Those games are just inviting for casual play sessions which is huge in the school year 
They have said it something they want to do 
Arcana spirits 
Inner Ability Link Skill setups https 
Feel free to apply to Downtime 
It looks pretty neat 
Unfortunately the skill has been updated like Cadena or Zero so the color change is pretty rough on the CPU 
When you anywhere below an extra badge or heart wo alleviate your problem much more than a single Master Craftsman cube will 
It not like you missing stat because you likely still not even going past Epic with occult cubes 
It a problem for the and hardly ever before that 
There always reasonable ways to gain stat without those two items beforehand and the cost involved is hardly ever less efficient 
Hell instead of doing a badge quest you better off doing Monster Park for a pot at those levels 
As a GMS streamer this is a pretty accurate representation of my thought process 
I would stream full time even if I could but the lack of adequate monetary incentive makes it difficult to commit long hours to at the cost of career responsibilities as much as I enjoy it as a hobby 
I got ta get food dollars before star force mesos lol 
That a great goal 
I glad you found it and that you have that joy in class pride and lore 
Congrats Chris 
Why do you want it again 
Do you have a source 
Am very interested 
And is this with hard cap

Go ahead and apply and whisper one of the leadership people whoever online 
Thank you for the detailed reply 
You may be the first person to really explain it so well 
Can you elaborate further on the prime line cubes 
We have some wonderful Japanese people in Downtime if you would like to join 

may be lacking but the question was asking which is technically true 
NL NW DB Merc Lumi Hero Mechanic Corsair Xenon Evan all have pretty high burst in 
is a little hard to quantify due to the high CD but still fits the bill 
Probably there are others as well 
You say that to me explicitly lol

No 
This is incorrect 
I am from NA Reboot and am living in NA and I had this bug yesterday 
It was fixed after several client restarts 

Oof that sounds like a headache 
I try to fiddle with it thanks 
No video of anything above from me sorry Here a SS of NW at from my Discord 
It not mine 
No Greed rune https Not sure if they still saved but I probably have some older VODs on Twitch of rotations 
My ping is as good for Dark Omen and I lazy so I only peaked at on a good hour p I try for higher soon 
Was able to watch the entire thing on mute thanks to you 
Still learned a lot so thank you 
I do use Lucid soul 
NW is more than just shot bats since we have other attacks that require more stat to be optimal 
Optimal is stat in meso gear or higher I would say 
But you can make good rates once bats one shot at around 
My NW makes about with buffs wealth and legion at 
Highest rates I heard NWs do is since they actually focus during farming 
Deepest path and CLP are about 
meso drop with 
How did you get the overlay to work 
Thinking of copying this for a tutorial video 
Just go ahead and apply If nobody gets back to you within hours feel free to bug any of the Jr or reply here 
I can accept you 
Spent for top pants Meister ring and crit 
Lost some stat though cause glove lost p Did think I could gain anything in 
Yes it is 
If you need to leave for a while we can keep track of that if you tell us 
Sounds like you had a bad experience 
If you willing to be generally active and cap contribution regularly times a week Downtime may be a suitable option 
If not I may have a few other guilds in mind that suit your tastes 
Please DM 
NW only on Omen which really only affects endgame meso rates and one niche mechanic 
Hi 
Feel free to reach out to any of the Juniors 
I a little preoccupied right now but they will be happy to help you through the process 
Thanks for the information 
Updated it in the master list 
Thought I updated it accordingly before 
Sorry for the confusion 
Will update now 
This should be higher up 
It not the biggest difference for most players 
It really only important if you care to eek out the last bit of stat 
Earring 
Americans do too lol 
Completely agreed 
People are toxic for any number of reasons 
I play a Night Walker and still get the botting accusations 
It just the community being them 
It depends on your purpose 
I have never ever found a Windows machine capable of performing technical tasks as well as my MBA has 
The only workaround is to install Linux which is generally unfavorable for everyday tasks 
Running a VM is even more ludicrous due to the battery consumption 
Oh and this MBA is almost years old now 
Still runs perfectly 
on both Maple Bootcamp or MacOS

Yes I understand your motivation 
I often do the same thing 
It interesting and intellectually stimulating to play the devil advocate sometimes 
I do have much time to do that right now unfortunately 
As someone who also speaks abrasively I warn you to be careful with your words sometimes 
It very easy to come off too strong and can turn people away from the actual core of the argument you presenting now 
I did and do the same thing p 
Not a single dark for Luk 
Several for Dex 
And on the last day back to back Dark Int followed by Another gold luk

Strong 
That being said I wager NW has the most number of lines for 
shadow partners bats and about additional lines for every one of those hits 
I understand you not coming from a place of malice and I appreciate that 
In the interest of time I would just like to point out that is against ToS and I take these accusations very seriously 
In any event you still do not understand Sticky Keys 
It does not manipulate the ordering of key sequences 
Macros automate key sequences without needing human intervention 
It is precisely that intervention clause that makes it illicit 
You will not engage in using macros macroing or robot play botting or any other behavior that allows you or any character you are controlling to automatically function or effect any action in a game or without your presence 
You can say I using a loophole and I can understand your reasoning from a utilitarian perspective 
As far as I am concerned deontologically the community has deemed it alright because of that requirement and it does not violate ToS 
So if it is both widely accepted and does not violate any law or regulation why do you use such an accusatory tone 
EDIT I would not be upset if you had not said that I hold myself on a moral high ground to insinuate that I look down on other players 
I have made myself very clear on multiple occasions that I only care about people violating rules when it comes under my jurisdiction in guild and alliance 
Ever since the clanta case I have deliberately avoided commenting significantly on any individual 
If you are referring to my SF video I have clarified my intent behind that on several occasions as well 
So I find it frustrating how you are still able to express such a passive aggressive opinion 
EDIT You are free to make any strawman arguments you like but the fact of the matter is that it is a Windows utility 
If it were a third party program then it would have never entered NW culture much less Illium and beyond 
You taking this too far and for very little reason in my opinion 
If you are saying that it has negative consequences then I invite you to challenge all of GMS attack speed then 
Huh I did know GCP had a free tier 
Do you know if it shut down first or charge you first 
EDIT Nevermind found the FAQ page haha 
I certainly will 
Thank you very much for the information 
I will look into it 
Sticky Keys does not automate anything 
It simply delays certain keypresses that the user still needs to do 
Nexon is required by Windows ToS through law to allow all accessibility functions built by Windows and thus SK can not ever violate ToS in any Nexon product 
I say it different because it is different from macroing in both definition and legal 
I mean my words literally 
Unless you are implying that hard attack speed cap is a bug then there is no argument 
It is literally impossible to hit hard cap without Sticky Keys 
In addition given that Sticky Keys is enabled directly in the Windows kernel as a method of performing actions for the disabled there is no legal way Nexon can ban it 
If you would like to debate the legality of Sticky Keys in any Windows program then you have to go to court with Microsoft and ultimately the courts over possible violations of the Disability Act 
Not to mention in order to use Windows Nexon has already accepted that they allow the use of Accessibility tools in all their software including Maple 
Furthermore Sticky Keys is not an automated program that replaces actions 
To quote Wikipedia Sticky keys is an accessibility feature of some graphical user interfaces to assist users who have physical disabilities or help users reduce repetitive strain injury or a syndrome called the Emacs Pinky 
It keystrokes instead of pressing multiple keys at a time allowing the user to press and release a modifier key such as Shift Ctrl Alt or the Windows key and have it remain active until any other key is 
A macro is defined as such A single instruction that expands automatically into a set of instructions to perform a particular task 
Sticky Keys still requires the user to press all the buttons required 
It NOT automate any 
do put yourself on some moral high ground when you do automate your playing Well thanks for trying to accuse me of being a botter then 
Maybe understand SK before saying so 
It a legal delay not an automated program 
I be happy to pull out Microsoft ToS for you but let not waste our time 
You just hold the two keys down starting with the modifier key 
The only downside I have using it with other classes are you need to have fj on a separate key 
Some classes only have the jump button so I have to take it off Alt 
Ooh 
This looks very promising 
Thank you 
Yeah it was an option I was considering 
I never done anything like this to scale so I not sure how to get started 
Fingers crossed a dark pops on the last day 
Nice work 
Just a heads up Circulators give max of ANY of the lines not just the first 

It a Windows setting to aid the handicapped in executing keyboard shortcuts 
So only classes that have the ability to continuously execute skills with keys pressed at the same time can benefit from it 
Night Walker is the classic example because they were the first ones to have a Jump Attack combination 
That has since expanded to Illium Blaster etc 
In theory these combinations are doable manually without relying on Sticky Keys 
However since those skill delay intervals are designed with KMS speed cap in mind the GMS attack speed cap of screws it up 
Therefore when you hard cap it is impossible to do those combinations without Sticky Keys 
The classes that do have the continuous attack combo can use sticky keys but it would make a difference 
The major disadvantage to SK is you have to play with the assumption that whatever last modifier key you pressed Alt Ctrl Shift may have been stickied already 
It like you playing without sticky keys and you inserted an extra Alt press before the following keypress 
That why a lot of times you watch NW insert extra arrow key presses in between skills to cancel out that extra modifier key press 
I want to be clear though this is different from macroing because it is built into Windows and is a delayed effect of a keypress enforced by the Windows kernel rather than an external program 
EDIT for people who might be thinking like JettNaps To clarify when I say it like you inserted an extra Alt press I mean that in the sense of time delay rather than to generate an additional keypress as would be found in macroing 
Arcana and Labyrinth of Suffering are just beautiful to me 
Until you get star belt 
Not the set 
I would reroll 
is already roughly stat 
May not be intended to be useful but this is extremely useful 
Thank you for compiling the data 
I been following Amazon holdings for a while 
I do have a list of sources compiled so here https is a good list someone else made 
The video is nice too 
Most notably you can examine the SEC holdings 
I believe Business Insider also has some references to their rising annual revenue and its makeup which you can find under some of their in NYC videos 
The chart also assumes jump rate when it more like at least 
remindme days 
If he capping with the final Shadow Partner he is hitting the equivalent of lines on his Quintuple which is interesting 
If you in Reboot here how to do rings https 
If you like Downtime is recruiting again We have a wide range of players from the new to the endgame 
The only real requirement is that you cap contribution and try to be active 
Of course we can make accommodations since Maple is a job 
From my three years in the guild I watched and supported many new players through to the late and endgame so I think we doing right 
That cute 
Now we can finally have an alternative to Aliens at at least D 
Amazon looking to expand into as many markets as possible to diversify their investment portfolio 
Since Amazon expertise is scalability and not a particular industry they are trying to get into markets to perform their scaling magic and return a profit as well as market domination 
It this business philosophy that helped them to create AWS which accounted for virtually all of their operating profit in 
This is not even factoring in the growth rate of their other business investments that are not profit centers but will be 
Nexon is one of such companies and can be converted to operate on even more data 
Gaming is a relatively easy industry to scale and Nexon has a proven track record of doing so effectively to an extent 
Does that answer your question 
Matt makes with inner 
Yeah 
I feel you It still an excellent ring though 
It not far from the Gollux D 
I see your outdated event ring with double primes and raise you this http 
That is the goal 
Mostly recycled just some values and details updated 
Not much has changed 
You welcome 
should this not even cross my mind 
my horrible first ever video https marginally less horrible video years later https Just start You pick up things as you go 
Night Walker is the only class worth playing Have you tried Evan 
Updated version in the works https 
It more like with half the cost 
What the hell 
We went up like ranks from FD 
Or is Shadow Spear really that bugged 
I would recommend checking out some higher profile twitch streams for setup tips 
It also will help with your comfort and overall ability to speak into a camera 
Do ever feel bad though 
For reference this https was my first ever video and it was after about a month of streaming lol 
At least you got some basic video editing down already 
the guy almost as strong as a night Lord I gon na borrow that joke took me a hot second to understand 
Nice edit 
You people are just looking to stir drama left and right 
Does matter if we all grill Zhong to the teeth 
still would lie and say we all botters at the end of the day 
Ridiculous 
And again I ask you one Jeff is enough to label all of us as botters sucking Zhong toes 

And so one Jeff is enough to label the entire podcast as a botcast 
Did you miss the other hours where Scardor myself Elluci and Kobe took turns explicitly defending Zhong 
Nobody jumped in to defend Zhong at all 
If you are going to accuse us all of being botters at least take the minutes to listen to the part you want to comment on 
K When you apologized in your video are you actually sorry for the actions that you did or are you sorry that you just got caught 
And if you did not get caught would you stil continue to be doing these things 
Z I mean obviously I made the video after I got caught 
Uhm no 
Cause the thing is after I got caught by the alliance member I agreed to reform 
I uninstalled everything and I just stopped using it 
What was the second part of your question 
K So if your alliance member did caught sic you you would still continue 
Z Most likely 
P If I was in Zhong shoes I would 
I mean I do think that goes without saying 
S I think it would be consistent 
I mean if you decide to start with it then you probably just trying to get away with it as long as possible 
That would be consistent 
Z Cause I mean no one cheats with the intention of getting caught so it just that mentality 
K True 
I mean at the same time I not gon na blame you if you say you would still keep doing it because if you did get caught nobody still knows right 
And it like nobody knows you do it so you feel like there still no wrong to keep going at anyway 
Like a lot of people who are in the chat saying that you got exposed by me they would still do the same thing 
So I dunno why they talking 
So I calling out now 
N I guess the question is like did you feel guilty while you were doing it 
So who interupted Kobe exactly 
With the exception of Jeff we were all grilling Zhong in various degrees trying to get into his head 
So much for a botcast 
I feel like NW jump rate should be closer to at least 
They buffed drop rate 
Drops like candy now 
For GMS we have Lab Server instead 
Only KMS has Maple M legion piece iirc 
From what I recall Quint is the only one 
Spear ca be reliably tested so if you going to test the relative difference between attack speed and not then it may not be as high as the listed 
I would need more testing 
AFAIK bats are not affected by AS to a statistically significant amount 
Shadow Bite is technically affected but realistically not affected because it weaves into our attack speed either way 
In fact because of sticky keys we may actually increase in DPS from the Bite in speed 
No way to cast bite seamlessly in Overall definitely a nerf 
I just not convinced it so high 
It worth noting that not all NW skills are affected by attack speed in the same consistent manner as other classes and that bat generation is not so easy to simulate 
Furthermore straw dummy tests are not accurate for us because spear FD does not proc 
It depends on attack speed indirectly but also on a Markovian assumption of bat hits 
essentially dummy BA is insufficient to test our attack speed benefit 
Honestly audio balancing is so difficult 
I wish there were better video guides on it On the one hand you do want to blow out the audience ears but you ca exactly maintain the same volume voice for hours 
Not sure if this is a serious question but he pulled it out of his closet after we asked if he like also had a secret body pillow with cute anime grill 
It a very cute bike 
I need to update that a little 
Please refer to the video link in the document and read the pinned comment for corrections OP 
Hopefully I can release an updated video soon so there no more confusion 
Lol I did even realize 
But that great 
I pleased D 
Can I join pls 

Have you tried a full restart of your PC 
There a guide on how to do that 
DM me the footage and I can try to help you 
Official reason was that this will increase server latency for similar reasons to Kishin 
I do get it 
In a month 
As cringe as it would be now 
I still ca wait 
Fucking decade 
Sounds like a guild 
sorry 
Lol it would be nice to get an Erda hoodie IRL 
It looks so comfortable 
I consider it 
IIRC That only if you want the individual stat bonuses from those 
If you only caring about one character a double set of links might not be bad 
Grid bonuses apply either way 
Thanks for the update 
Used to be for competition and achievement 
Now it just to be able to help people have fun 
For any new player I would suggest these two guides to be used in combination Equipment Guide https Training Guide https Meso Farming Guide in text thanks https Just keep in mind to be if you pursue the Kanna meso farming option 
Assuming proper DPS Will is more difficult particularly if people in your party have ping 
Phase will those people unfortunately 
If you like Downtime is currently open 
just whisper a We have a Discord mostly for text chat with plenty of organized guides information and other support for newcomers 
If we are not right for you you would also be welcome at any of the allied guilds each with their own culture and personalities 
I believe this will be a good first door for you to open 
Thanks 
I understand the suspicion 
I would be lying if I said I had thought about that same question myself even as a Reboot streamer 
Being a public figure a leader and a generally person typing this in between projects I just a little tired 
I used to be rather aggressive and vigilante about what is legit and not but now I just try my best to uphold my guild and alliance rules 
This is just my opinion 
I think we have rules in the community particularly in guilds to establish common ground and inspire new players by saying this person did it so I can too 
Unfortunately we have taken these rules as hammers to beat those condemned as hard as possible 
Frankly I suspect a good portion of my buddy list as having broken the rules significantly not the gray area but under the umbrella that Zero drew 
I am still friends with them but I avoid letting them into my guild 
tldr I believe that rules exist and we should try to uphold them particularly if it clear that it not a gray area issue 
Yet I still aim to be civil with those that do break the rules just as we would with a child with his hand in the cookie jar 
I ca speak for other streamers but at least for me I always find it difficult to decide to farm on stream 
I believe my job is ultimately to entertain and educate my viewers 
Yet I hesitant to farm on stream because it is so repetitive and it scares me that people will be too bored and turn away from the stream forever 
At the end of the day I still farm on stream a lot but it not so easy to convince myself that I can keep people interested for so long doing the same thing over and over again 
Maybe that laughable and maybe I just too paranoid but hopefully this sheds some light into a part of one streamer mindset 
It been close to two years since I started streaming and that fear of boring people is still alive and well 
enjoy my friend 
Gear Guide for OP https Training https 
As much as you can 
I know it a long request 
Just trying to piece together what we can 
Try V Sync off 
I have a worse PC than you and it works fine for the most part 
What about them 
Thank you 
Hopefully at least some things will make it through 
I will try to be in as close communication with the team as I can be although my hope is that others will take this chance to put their support behind these points to garner Nexon attention 
It seems unlikely that KMS would ever adopt characters 
What you saying does make sense though and I appreciate you taking the time to point it out 
Would you like me to elaborate that under class balancing 
Do you mean the KMS one 
Thanks for clarifying your points 
First I can agree with you on the symbol selectors given that KMS devs seem to be opting for a stretching out of gameplay which makes the idea relatively unlikely 
Second with regards to Gollux I did not suggest to restock Gollux in order to combat botters 
That is a separate issue to tackle and as much as I believe we should shut off the valve with increased account creation standards it somewhat outside the point 
What is relevant to the Gollux discussion is player accessibility 
Based on what you have said you seem to believe that allowing more legitimate access by gameplay would damage meso income strategies 
What are we to do then 
We can both agree that the GMS meso value is inflated due to bots and that the natural influx of legitimate mesos can not compete with the botted economy 
As a consequence most players are forced to buy mesos or earn easy goods like Gollux 
In either case they are inevitably forced to acquire mesos from the bots 
If it were not for Gollux new players would be forced to find yet another commodity to trade as a for the currency 
Many other games combat this inflationary problem with alternate currencies it just so happens that Gollux is our alternate 
Yet given MapleStory reliance on SF we still inevitably need to rely on mesos 
It a strange but the ultimate goal should not be to continue a system where every player relies on bots but one where the bots are barred from the economy and the meso appreciates to a point relatively close to KMS 
Perhaps I should make this more clear in a thesis 
We have become so complacent with the bots depreciating meso value that we have collectively decided to accept the bots into the economy as it ultimately gives us an easier time with Star Force 
Now maybe this is coming from a Stockholm Syndrome effect but I am and will never be content with calculating player accessibility by relying on bots 
Call me oldschool but that how the markets worked for in the beginning years and I have no desire to stop until the bots are dealt with and the economy is properly restored 
With that idea comes the conjecture that if we remove large bot meso influxes the sinks will bring the value to an equilibrium 
regards to the point what would you like me to do 
There seems to be a select number of people permanently infused with the idea that I take criticisms as personal attacks 
look at the various comments in this thread criticizing and otherwise suggesting feedback for my work 
With a few exceptions over the past two years to which I have apologized I have been patient and appreciative of the thousands of feedbacks I have received 
thing that annoys me is not criticism but the way in which it is presented 
From the Saiyans snobby comment of maybe you should verify your information before making a one hour video to the various kinds of snide comments I receive do you think I am not justified in being a little annoyed 
are times where I have lost my temper I am only human 
But to suggest that I take all criticisms as personal attacks is disingenuous at best 
I politely warned you that your words could be understood as a character assassination and you took that as me being incredibly insulted and unwilling to take criticism 
Is that my overreaction or yours 
I not allowed to make a few jokes on stream 
If you interpret them as snide remarks then I invite you to tell me and perhaps I can clarify my wording 
I have been explicit in that many times over and if you intend to continuously attribute my words to malice then there is nothing I can do 
I do know how I can be more explicit that feedback and criticism are welcome 
I have responded to the majority of feedback and criticism kindly 
If I do not respond to yours in the exact same manner perhaps it is communication skills and not my attitude 
If someone agrees with me what more is there to say 
Shall I argue with them and force them to disagree 
If someone disagrees then I feel I owe them the time to explain my position and try to convince them 
If they still do not accept then that is their choice and I leave them alone 
But if they do not accept and then return to attack me would you fault me for defending myself 
And yes Bera is just a bug under my formatting 
As noted I will continue to improve the priority listing 
That is yet another toppic I will hopefully infuse into the thesis 
EDIT In fact if you have the time please show me where exactly in the first podcast I was being snide 
I would love to see what you mean 
EDIT Again just look at the comments in this thread alone 
have responded to every comment with at least professional courtesy if not genuine appreciation 
Why do you think I am taking such issue with you 

Thank you for the personal anecdote 
I will see if I can incorporate this 
Yes that is a major concern right now 
That was the primary reason why I did not release this list originally 
I will cut down on low priority issues once the edits die down 
Thank you 
You have a valid concern 
I will consider removing this for the sake of removing bloat as this was not originally included 
Thanks for the feedback 
First I want to be very clear I am considering both Reboot and 
I know I have not considered enough which is why this is here 
Second let talk about your points For Gollux the infinite Gollux restock is not damaging to the normal server economy 
I ask that you be clear with what constitutes abuse because an increase in legal accessory exchanges will only decrease prices and increase economic activity in those servers 
A natural price equilibrium will form in a few months with the higher end Gollux accessories still remaining quite valuable due to the difficult not being scarcity of replacement but the scrolling and cubing 
As such an increase in goods traded will only be beneficial for overall economic movement because more players will be allowed earlier entry into the market 
Forgive me for presuming but the few people who have raised objections about this on the vague grounds of abuse all appear to have a vested interest in keeping prices artificially high 
Why is this 
From what I can tell it seems because they are the few players who have stocks of these items and such a change would cause them to lose on their investment 
This has become increasingly clear to me over the past month as the only people who have been opposed to this change have been the monopolists if I may use that word 
I do know if you are one of those people but I will point out that just saying it will be abused with no logical will not be well received 
For the Tenebris topic you bring up droplet exchange 
That is effectively what I have proposed 
I do know why you are against that 
For the Symbols I am and have been very clear that this is not just a Reboot issue 
You will notice that I have been careful to not add any Reboot tags to the symbols because this is fundamentally a game design issue The highest level content should have equivalent if not better rewards than earlier content 
Right now the opposite is true 
The only reason the Reboot meso penalty is included is because it is also intimately related to the highest level content 
It is a not a direct consequence of symbols and droplets 
Third for the KMS cash shop issue I refer you to this http I believe you are misunderstanding what that cash shop is and so please read the link above 
I want to be very clear I have tried very hard to be as impartial about this as possible 
You have put me as a Reboot player ignorant of normal server affairs intentionally or not 
However for the three points you raise I and many others have already considered for both servers and have written them to reflect such thoughts 
I appreciate your feedback but I sincerely hope you will not accuse me of being ever again 
The writing is very clear in the document for normal server issues and you are free to contribute if you feel they are lacking 
This kind of argument is honestly a character assassination rather than a logical rebuttal 
I understand you have no but please be aware that your words carry such meaning 
Thanks again for the feedback and I glad you enjoyed the list 
Yes we will be working on fleshing out the solutions tonight 
I appreciate your feedback 
Keep in mind that the document is open to public edit suggestions so the Arcane Symbol reversion thing was not something I originally suggested 
I understand what you going for 
I was originally going to do this but it ended up being extremely bloated 
I will work with a friend tonight and try out what you said if we can condense the categories into better defined groups Thanks for the response 
Your feedback is noted although that is exactly what I have tried to do 
This list was one page long lol the suggestions 
KMS developers have recently introduced Arcane River Party Quest daily for VJ which is why I believe it to be feasible 
If you have other organizational methods please feel free to introduce them in the document 
As of now I have not found another way to condense effectively 
My original idea was along your lines focusing on major design issues only 
However given the outpouring of community feedback I believe there is a clear desire to have them be communicated effectively 
If you disagree please make a note in the doc 
I appreciate it 
The more the merrier 
Thank you 
They have made GMS specific changes for GMS specific content in the past 
That is particularly why I tried to focus on content over KMS content 
The KMS points are mostly for organized feedback for the Korean devs who we know are in closer communication with the Global developers now 
I understand 
Give me a few minutes please 
What if I were to expand that point to party play in general 
From meso sharing to exp to rewards 
Yes I will start to introduce color codes if possible 
This will be one of the categories 
Thank you 
Yes I recognized that issue from the outset of this project 
I will continue to try and highlight particular issues color code for players quitting etc 
Unfortunately as mentioned comparing issues is rather difficult because I have no way to properly gauge every issue effects on the playerbase 
I will keep thinking on how to make such comparisons easier for any readers to make 
The ban appeal system is included in the customer support section 
I could not go into extreme detail for the sake of space but I will see if there is any clarification I can make 
Thanks for the feedback 
EDIT If you have particular issues you feel are more important than is noted please comment in the doc 
Hi 
If you have any concerns or need any please feel free to DM me on Discord at Sam CodeNox 
I will try to respond in a timely manner 
Thanks for the quick response 
Thanks for the feedback 
As noted I tried to sort the issues as much as possible within each section 
Based on the previous feedback and upvotes I prioritized certain sections accordingly to the best of my ability 
I could consider highlighting particularly important issues in yellow 
Not sure which ones unfortunately 
EDIT Are you seeing your suggestion in the list 
I not sure if I properly 
I assuming you on Reboot 
Do Ursus and as many daily bosses as you can for your first starting mesos 
Follow the Kanna track to either or 
In either event you may now go into a normal server with good Gollux ring prices do prequest sell them for mesos trade for Maple Points and use said points to buy skills and pet if with no events 
Or avoid Kanna until Maple Point event comes back 
First route is very time costly as you can imagine 
I personally would just wait or find bucks 
You welcome 
There is a reason why Frenzy is not common despite having been out for over two years 
The large money barrier makes that a prophecy 
They are not subject to power creep nor are they as easy to acquire as a Kanna 
To compare Kishin to Frenzy in cardinality is like comparing the number of cars driving from New York to DC to the number of rockets landing on the Moon 
It possible to get but only to a few people with a lot of concetrated wealth 
Even in the best case scenario most people would never own a rocket only pay large amounts of money to share it 
If you would like to optimize your life then do play 
Laws are defined by the ToS but if you would like to ignore them to prioritize other things in your life then there are many more ways to connect with friends 
Perhaps private servers are more your speed 
You not playing in a sandbox but in a community 
Your actions affect others whether you intend to or not 
You may not care because it Nexon but you are more hurting other players by trying to normalize and devalue others' hard work 
Frenzy is inherently rare due to and is insignificant 
And yes see the Kishin Maple Memo 
I believe Robert linked it ITT EDIT http 
They can not 
As they said that too taxing on the servers 
I sorry but false bans is not an excuse to be illegitimate 
I do like a lot of what happening either but that does give me the free pass to ignore rules 
Haha I just do upload fails that all 
altho that was one hell of a day 
There may be compensation because of the increased SF costs in GMS 
I do know why people rarely mention this 
the guide should work well for both 
If there anything I would start by soloing Hard Gollux I did so at range by sniping since I a NW 
Ranged classes can do that even if the run takes minutes 
Sorry that was a mistake on my part 
Always feels nice to see this being referenced 
I make sure to update it soon 
Many reasons 
The most logical and primary of which is the fact that we have doubled Star Force costs to account for Kishin 
Many things in this game were either balanced with that in mind or is inevitably affected by that now that it been many years 
I so sorry 
You will be behind star something along the lines of stat and attack 
I forget and stat from not being able to use transposed flame SW earring at stars 
You will also not be able to ever use star Hard Lucid belt 
Unless you are looking to absolutely though you will be okay for all intents and purposes 
I still sorry though 
Your next steps in remedying this problem is to do what you said transfer hammer earring to get a star Superior Earring 
Then also wear a or however much you want transfer hammer advised Superior Belt 
I would also continue to petition Nexon for Gollux Shop restock 
If that too risky then it also possible to take a screenshot and run it through an image classifier to find the required inputs 
A visual captcha is useful if it has a lot of variance 
This kind of captcha is beyond useless for preventing bots 
It is with legion and wealth in endgame maps 
I not so sure for BM because ca be bound 
Maybe would make up for a whole DPS but it does seem kinda tricky 
They might be taken just because parties who run Hilla together would run BM together honestly 
And maybe they get solo buffed in a few weeks 
Turn NumLock on 
That the only solution 
I am aware of my biases 
That is why I am confident in making the assessment that Trump is not a net positive for the country 
It seems clear to me that Trump has not been performing at an objectively acceptable level 
If he shapes up and performs well I will have no issue with the man 
It as simple as that 
If you would like to accuse me of being influenced by some idiot opinion article then all I can say is that I have not and will not be 
Competence is all I care about frankly 
Enough with this political shit 
If he gives me enough factual reasons to like him then I will 
As of now that has rarely ever happened 
The comparison was one in degree but direction 
There is some anti Trump propaganda but it like saying that there is some attempts at slandering Hitler 
The guy and his Party have been shitting on the country for years which is why people actually want to bring them down 
Falsehood and bad journalism are horrible but you missing the larger picture with your response 
Is there a quick guide for formatting and templates to support porting 
Looking to organize my guides there but I do know how to format for that site 
Ultimate dark sight' 
I never said that 
I eat healthy exercise and have a good job 
I contributed far more in taxes than I could ever take away from the government 
That does mean horrible things ca happen unexpectedly to people through no fault of their own 
That what universal healthcare alleviates which you seem to take as just oh lazy people do want to work and just want a free handout 
It just ridiculous 
At what point do you want to realize that the majority of people not only WANT to work but DO work and still ca keep up with medical bills in this country 
The fucking richest country in the world ca afford to keep its meager amount of citizens healthy 
Wind Archer meets WH meets BaM 
I not gon na sit here and explain to an adult how medical bills can rack up for anything 
Maybe if you live long enough you get to experience it yourself 
A large portion of taxes the misses are from various financial trading investment firms private equity corporate revenue and in the various industrial sectors 
Just because people have jobs does mean they can afford health care 
Just wait until you and have to have a kidney transplant 
That costs over on average 
Or do you want a lung transplant after a car accident 
healthcare is ludicriously expensive and is why insurance helps us shoulder all those burdens by having us all pay for a small portion 
Good luck having an extra quarter of a million dollar emergency fund by having a normal job in America 
stuff is funded by taxes is as simple as you people imagine 
Is this becoming an ecchi sub 
For some operations even someone making an hour ca pay for 
Asking an individual to pay millions for advanced procedures is what healthcare is there to prevent 
Ideally we all shoulder a little burden to offset in case it happens to us 
In a few months 
It in the KMS balancing 
Their beer is a liquid number one 
Wait does it give HP 
I did see it in the skill description 
That being said having to remake gear is a problem 
Ah thanks 
Ah that unfortunate 
Thanks 
Cygnus and Resistance links are stackable 
I would be surprised if we cleared it week 
That already been resolved 
It intended 
Just being generally polite and conversational 
Not too aggressive as people said 
Voice chat should only be used during team play like a raid or boss fight where there is a clear reason for doing so 
Otherwise it an immediate no 
For the books try 
It a theory 
Of course we could be wrong 
It just seems suspicious with over a year of data and with the Reboot drop formula being fundamentally different 
In any event it would be nice to hear Nexon confirm it on way or the other 
If we wrong no problem It also become a suspicion on KMS Reboot from what I gather which was partly what inspired our attention 
They do drop yes 
However the number of recorded drops seems very disproportionate to normal servers given similar parties 
I think I understand what you saying 
Thanks for clarifying 
Thank you for the extended feedback 
If you have more ideas would you be able to help me and use bullet points 
I have to condense a lot of the suggestions and merge them so reading through a wall of text is rather difficult haha 
Does it happen outside of spirit savior 
Very nicely said 
Had thought about that at all 
I guess I should make a list of all the solutions backtrack to the problem merge list suggested solutions 
Excellent insight 
Thank you 
A small bat 
Damn that good 
The other requests are in progress I typically get from auto buff happening at the same time 
Are you saying it not exclusively to auto buff but general client lag 
If you Marlon you carry even with stat 

I understand now 
Perhaps checking Lie Detectors with significant restrictions to prevent abuse 
That is true 
I will see if it is appropriate to include it for consistency 
That is an internet issue likely with your Wifi signal strength ISP quality or DNS settings 
I would call your ISP and ask for technical support 
You are suggesting RP Bpot cubes yes 
What are the current ways to sell perm NX 
Sorted as bug 
Are there other cases of maps doing this 
Thank you 
I think I understand what you mean 
It be hard to specify exact changes but I try 
What do you say to the earlier comment on its effects on the market 
If you could please refer to BobTheFifth comment chain earlier 
If you do know that alright 
Thanks for the feedback 
Is that from a Reboot or normal server perspective 
I will try my best to make these as clear as possible for her 
It not the best case scenario but hopefully we can help her learn 
I include that under universal buff freeze on logout 
As in from EMS GMS 
I can see if that is relevant to include although I really do think that likely 
Noted particularly the pot lines 
If that not possible how much do you think is reasonable per hour 
Noted thanks 
We see 
Did realize this would get almost points May have to find a different medium to represent this 
I keep that in mind 
Any particular method you want them to fix 
That would be great thanks 
Can you specify what that means 
Have played Illium in a long time 
It a boss entry map so that consistent 
I can lump this with the other boss teleport comment 
I can point that last part out 
Gotcha 
I actually have the same problem lol 
That falls under Sengoku and Wondroid 
Thanks 
I not sure if they already did the Kritias thing in KMS 
Keep in mind we actually have an older version of Kritias cause we never got Hekaton 
Would practice mode be enough for you 
They were trying to fix people carrying then running again to get more meso 
I hear you but I do think that feasible 
I can add the SF animation idea if there is appropriate room 
Same with the coupons likely in with universal buff freezing on logout 
Lomien is already addressed 
Yeah I get the concern 
Thanks for your input 
Also this is a list of issues the community thinks should be addressed first not just every discontinuity in the game 
That why I was balancing the input 
Seems to be in favor of speaking about it so far contrary to what I anticipated 
Yes I misunderstood you the first time 
Edited the previous reply 
I think I get the gist of what you saying though 
Been thinking about this myself 
That is a bug 
Thanks for the reminder 
I do believe KMS has addressed this either 
Thanks for the clarification 
I will see how I can synthesize this 
Yes I understand 
For Reboot that part of the design philosophy 
I ca get into it right now which is why I asked if you meant normal servers or Reboot 
I get the general gist of what you mean though 
I keep it in mind 
True 
I can include it although I really do know how to specify 
That is interesting and a good point 
In any event I may remove that instanced bit or expand it to normal servers hence the 
From what I can tell KMS Reboot caps at with in the bigger maps 
may have been the GMS meta maps comparison 
By the way if you like to talk about normal server Gollux restocking can you reply to one of the top comments in this thread the one where that topic forgot username 
It be nice to see a debate between two normal server players 
It not that simple unfortunately 
For example the Kinesis attacks are fixed to be at a certain speed especially since they automatic 
With hurricanes one potential issue is aligning the frame rates and removing any possible bugs from input key speed since skills will depend on the user millisecond input 
That may require reconsidering all game inputs in the game 
I ca know more than that or for certain 
But I would wager it rather complicated particularly in EDIT For general class balancing it a comparison problem requiring knowledge of the classes 
I agree that they can do it but I do work at Nexon so I really have no idea what they otherwise preoccupied with 
Might be helpful for us to start creating more regular GMS DPS charts to reflect what KMS does 
Gotcha 
Thanks 
Not enough manpower presumably 
I forgot the exact conversation behind it 
That being changed in KMS 
Also there is no exchange mechanism from drops daily cores 
If you would still like that mechanism I can consider including it 
I just not sure there a for it 
Yeah 
I wanted to include it in the post as I mentioned 
I just do want to get skewered honestly 
I see if I can flesh that idea out when I compile this 
thumbs 
Ah I experienced that before sometimes 
From what I can tell it been auto buff is recasting 
Can you test it 
I see 
Overalls ca be anviled to bottom 
Let me make sure I understanding you correctly Kanna random teleport is worse than blink because of No attack limit unlike other skills cost it does technically cost Mana iirc 
It unique combination with being able to teleport and attack No CD Is that right 
Would you mind recording that 
Is it just in bosses or does it happen in field as well yes I know you wo die in field but it may help with debug 
Can you be a bit more specific 
I have seen that issue before 
Seems to be mostly a ping issue 
I update the sheet tomorrow 
It does happen in KMS much right 
Gotcha 
It already in the list 
Gotcha 
For the record I personally do think the KMS balancing is an issue 
Personally the second option is more likely based on what they done in the past 
That a great idea 
Would you like to help me with that 
It quite a big undertaking 
Yes you did 
You were rather passive aggressive about it so I asked you to clarify simply 
No need to kill the messenger 
I not a dev 
Just trying to help without getting skewered by both sides 
Gotcha 
The SF changes and droplets was if Kishin is removed 
That the general consensus of the Reboot server which is why it there 
That is because of the PC meta and the stuff related to that 
For Hard Boss drops the reasoning was to make it consistent with everything else in Reboot 
There are some issues with that hence the 
mark 
I actually was doing Gollux restock for everyone but there was some resistance against that from normal servers 
See the comment above 
GMS makes about the meso rates 
I just compiling people opinions at this stage 
Thanks 
Gotcha 
Yeah I noticed that as well 
Would you like me to include it then 
Username checks out 
Can you give a bit more reasoning for these points 
Gotcha 
Thanks 
Yes that is what I referred to in my post 
It rather sensitive and there are people asking me to include it and exclude it 
Would you like me to explicitly include buffing attack speed if possible or keeping it as is if not 
Keep in mind that may mean they will nerf it due to certain class difficulties e Kinesis 
GMS exclusive balancing is not possible in case you are wondering 
This is verified 
Would that be in conjunction with the Kishin replacement strategy or on top of 
What is the current situation 
I do anvil often 
Also if you could limit yourself to editing one comment that would be appreciated 
Are you suggesting a conversion 
Is this referring to Reboot or the PSOKing in normal 
Also would you want to see more items in the exploration or just higher rates of the good stuff like flames 
What would be a good Arcane Force rate then 
They are already making VJ easier and introducing events 
If that not enough what is your desired rate to maxed symbol 
If it is would you want to see more party type things for the other regions as well 
SF rates do not impact droplet rates 
Did you mean drop rate 
And based on your following points meso rate as well 
Are the new KMS boss crystal buffs enough for you to make them reasonable 
If not what would be a reasonable amount 
If you do know what I referring to please see Max blog 
For your final point something like right click to extract 
Thanks 
Godspeed for you in MSEA 
Thanks 
Is there any particular skill or set of skills 
Or pretty much just everything 
Gold beach fits that bill a bit 
What is a reason for them to do a separate version just for Florina 
And where would you say is a decent level assuming it still in Victoria Island 
Aside from the trolls and mindless haters there are some legitimate arguments and resentment on both sides 
How about an expansion on cross world events similar to CWPQ 
I probably put that under ping issues 
If I recall correctly they were addressing that a while ago but never really fixed it 
Thanks 
Very interesting suggestion at the end 
Is that due to the cluttering of the lightbulb 
Also how many BPot cubes do you think is appropriate for RP since the tier up rate is different 
they are right 
I see 
Out of curiosity have you got the link where they said that 
Good luck at your new job Aru 
You really stepped up when it mattered 
I can only imagine how difficult your job was and we appreciate the effort you put in 

That is the hope 
I respect opinions and not include unless otherwise asked 
Like a timer setting 
Great list 
Do you think the slot chair bag solves the chair issue or would you still prefer collections 
It seems like they are releasing that regularly now 
Thanks 
Bullet points help a lot 
Thanks for your honesty 
I keep that in mind 
World server merge and transfer is already listed 
I update the others later 
Good 
That was the goal 
I check your other reply soon 
Thanks 
The list is just starting which is from my perspective as an endgame player 
If you have other suggestions as a midgame or early game player just leave a comment 
Are you asking for a revamp or just return 
I think you assuming a lot about me and what I do 
I do know what I done to warrant that opinion in the past year but I can assure you I just a dude trying to compile information with the limited time I have 
You would be surprised honestly 
I do know as many people as people think 
Why do you think it took me so long to clear Hard Will 
I respect normal servers as I do Reboot 
I admit I ca know much about them but I certainly respect the players 
The only time I ever really get upset with normal server players is when they do try and divide the community on irrelevant things like oh Reboot plebs or whales who do know how to play What you saying may be true to some people but a stereotype is just that 
Thanks for the encouragement 
I update the list when I have time 
Would you reckon reverting the drop nerf for normal servers too

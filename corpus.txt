Well I read all of that and I genuinely apologetic on the behalf of this whole culture that I have probably unconsciously participated in
It unfortunately true that issues of body positivity in men have just not attracted nearly as much attention as for women and that obviously something that we as a society need to work on not to detract from that struggle for women of course but to make it clear that it does not just apply to them
I hope you end up finding someone who appreciates you in a sexual sense at some point

Sometimes you have to laugh
Not everyone wants to be identified by their sexuality
So it probably not so much denial as much as it is a resistance to be put into a category because of his sexual preference
Some people enjoy sex with the same sex occasionally but do not want to deal with all the baggage that comes along with other people knowing about it

I matched with a girl who only had group pics that were far off
She asked me to meet at the parking garage to her apartment complex
I got there and she messaged for me to come to one side and when I got there she was leaning out of the doorway doing the come here motion with her fingers
I came to that entrance and she was down the hall leaning out of the elevator doing the come here motion again
I got to the elevator and she had her back turned
I stepped in and the doors closed as she turned around
It wasn t a girl it was a guy in a wig
I kind of froze in place and wasn t able to say anything at first
I finally got out the sentence I m not comfortable with He said What
It s not gay if I just suck your I again said I wasn t comfortable with this and started pushing the door open button as fast as I could

She trying to be a personality on Instagram but rarely posts
Based on my experienced with her I genuinely worried she kill herself in the next year or two because aside from being pretty she really has amounted to much and when you dealing with a lifelong mental illness the opportunities for you to get on the right track stars diminishing pretty quickly

When I was in grade my school decided to create an orchestra since we only had a band I joined and immediately loved it
I used to look forward to every rehearsal I loved the hobby and also the fact that we all just vibed with each other best two years of my life
Then everything fell apart the school hired a new teacher I think it was because she would accept a lower pay since she was from Venezuela
I mean I from Per� and many people take advantage of the crisis and pay the immigrants way less than they should because they really need the job so I really blame the school for this
She was awful
She was part of an orchestra back in her country she could play very well but as a teacher she was a total disaster
She got only hours of rehearsal per week and did absolutely nothing to ask for more time it was like she did care She made us play the same damn thing for or presentations while the band played several new pieces every time
Basically we were the disgrace of the school
She insisted on including the children from the elementary violin classes into the former orchestra
Guess what they always fucked up
This happened mostly because almost every kid in that class just joined because their parents wanted them to they did really liked it and had little to zero motivation
She had no patience this was bad but once she decided to include the children it was a lot worse because they could get a passage right or could read sheet music that well
Obviously this resulted in them not learning their part well
Something was just off we did like her her attitude especially
The previous teacher was so nice understanding and it was just like a family
With her we did even want to see her we just went to rehearsal because we felt like we had a compromise
Due to all the motives listed before every presentation was even more shitty than the previous one
They were so bad I would end up crying of frustration every time
Two or three of the orchestra members switched to band I do blame them at all I should have left earlier too and at least of us just left
By August after pur worst presentation I decided I had had enough and I told her I quit
After what happened last year everyone in the orchestra just left and even though there a new teacher this year no one has joined again
It like she really killed all our motivation and passion for music with her bullshit
And I still a little sad because I loved orchestra and I miss it so much but now there nothing

I ve got two to share My senior year a group of guys snuck on to the roof of the high school then down into the AC vents mission impossible style and managed to evade all of the security systems
They then hoisted all of the chairs from the classrooms out through the windows and up into neat rows on the roof

I sold a bunch of stuff and borrowed money from my dad to scrape together
One of the things I sold was this Ibanez acoustic guitar my mom gave me for Christmas
I sold it to a music store for
A couple months later a friend who is a guitar player asked me where it was so I told him the story and he told me I should have talked to him first
He told me he would have bought it off me for a better price because he had always liked it
He had actually noticed I never played it and was trying to decide whether to ask me about buying it

I saw Flying Lotus at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday
I told him how cool it was to meet him in person but I didn t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything
He said Oh its all good dude My heart was warmed and all I could say was Thanks and he kept patting me on the back and going no problem bud and he chuckled heartily
I walked away and continued with my shopping and I heard him chuckle as I walked off
When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him accidentally walking out the doors with fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like Sir you need to pay for those He immediately realized his mistake and went back to pay for the Milky Ways
When she took out multiple bars and started scanning them individually he stopped her and told her you can scan the same Milky Way to make things go faster Then he turned around and smiled at everyone
He was really chill about it
After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag he went outside to give out Milky Ways to everyone around him
That a good one

Kids
A Study of the Consequences of Your Poor Decision Making
Dang
I have
This has bothered me for years and years
I ve never had a girlfriend and I have given up
When I thought girls did like me I was just being played
I got numerous dating apps and nothing ever came of them
Everyone within a mile radius saw me and said NOPE Whenever I liked someone she was into someone else
And I often had to see these people the girls I wanted and the boys who were better than me
I saw three separate counselors over it
I fell for one girl so hard
And we didn t even go out or anything
That girl was where I decided I was done trying
I have tried talking girls I lost track after that and I have just come to accept that I will never find someone who will want me
They will always go for the better guy
The taller wealthier more muscular arrogant prick
when I was a kid I was told that trying your best will lead to success
I tried my best for as long as I could remember
And I still lost to some other guy
I hate to sound like a whiner but is what has been bothering me for the past several years
This is the reason I ve withdrawn
This is the reason I have had to go to counseling
This is the reason I ve been more emotionally unstable
This is why I don t like going out in public anymore
This is the reason I attempted suicide
This is the reason I don t like to watch movies that involve relationships
This is the reason I spend more time alone
This is the reason I hate myself
This is the reason I m mad all the time
This is the reason why I ultimately don t care about my physical appearance anymore
And to top it all off nobody wants to help me
They just tell me that I m wrong for feeling this way
They tell me why I feel this way
My own dad told me that I didn t need a girlfriend to be I replied with why did you and everyone else get one then To which he stormed off like a child
Sorry you had to put up with this rant of mine here
I could continue for a few more hours if I wanted to
But this issue has been a parasite on my life for years
It has consumed me almost entirely
It has been what I think about all day long every day for several years
And it s killing me
What plane to pick up women with
Fargo

My heckin chonker
Yup
Cyrus the Great of Persia famously became an icon for his look
Specifically his eye makeup
People imitated his look for well today even
I a straight guy and i sometimes apply mascara just for fun the dark contrast between my green eyes and mascara is really pleasant to look at
My ex gf all liked applying mascara on me
I think of makeup like turning us into human canvasses
Living art
It beautiful
I really do want to come across as misogynistic
I all for girls using as little or as much makeup as they like
But I personally LOVE a girl with pretty makeup
I been a hobby artist all my life and it nothing like Girls need makeup to be pretty it artistic expression and really draws me in as an art form
Again I a straight American guy and wish I could wear makeup sometimes
Throw some lemon juice in the water and you golden

Coolest mental helper in the fallout shelter

When I home alone my go to meals are Salad
Simple pasta with whatever veggies I have on hand olive oil and some cheese
Potato hash just diced up potatoes with peppers and onions and a couple of fried eggs on top

You have to have someone in your life you love enough to break your heart first
I grew up in a dangerous environment where everyone used profanity more than actual words
My family was and I am being serious the only family to not curse
I never came across anyone who didn t swear outside of my family
Because people were so dangerous I associated swearing with dangerous people
I ve long since moved past that notion though I still don t feel comfortable hearing people swear
Pulp fiction
Samuel Jackson is the only human character
Gimp scene with muppets sounds hilarious
Deadpool keep Ryan Reynolds obviously
I met up with this girl on a Friday night after talking for a month or two
I went over to her place and made her steak mashed potatoes and corn for dinner because she d had a long day
She d made mention during one of our first talks that that was her favorite meal so I figured might as well make her day a little bit earlier
We wound up making out after cleaning up the dishes right there in the kitchen
After we moved things back to her bedroom things got awesome
The things this girl could do still make me wonder if this was a dream
After a few minutes she decides she wants to handcuff my hands and feet
I m all for it let s play
She also blind folded em
Here s where it gets weird
We d had our talk about what was off limits before we started getting hot and heavy
I told her if there was something she thought about midway through just ask
She wanted to try some butt play and I ve never received before
And she didn t ask she just started shoving a dry dildo up my butt
I wriggled as hard as I could even though I wasn t really going anywhere
I wound up shouting at her to stop saying my safe word and it took a good fifteen seconds before she finally stopped
I m all for trying new things but respect your partners enough to honor their boundaries

Fozzie Uh Phil that one I happen to agree with

So I say what do you want To which I am met with I don t know that s why I asked you
I say I don t know either haven t thought about it
Then I get another big followed by I ll figure it This is followed with about a half hour of her not talking to me and everything feeling awkward because I didn t have an answer when she asked Why am I now the source of the issue
I am responded to like I have cause a problem I don t understand this of us had an answer but me not having one when she asked causes a negative mood and her making it seem as if I don t care or whatever
I asked her what she wanted tonight and she said I have ideas
So I asked for said ideas and was met with silence
I told her I want to hear your ideas
Tell me the things you have thought And I was met with silence sighs and why do always have to choose
I told her the same thing I always say it s not on you to choose but I don t like being the bad guy because I don t know
You put it on me to choose and then get upset that I don t have an answer
You also don t have an answer
What did I do wrong here
Guess who didn t get laid tonight
AITA
Please someone honestly give me their opinion
If it s me I want to know
I just don t understand what I did wrong by not having an answer when asked only to be followed with an upset and a I ll figure it out followed by the silent treatment

It was one of the first games I remember playing
Sure it objectively bad with clunky controls but the concept is gold imo
When he first got the Army Men game I asked why their whole bodies were one color and why they were so tiny
He realized that I never played with toy soldiers before so he went to the store and bought me a bag
I was expecting the gift and it made me so happy
Those soldiers and that game made a huge impact on my childhood
I still have the game and a few of the army men to this day

EMDR legitimately saved my life
I fond of Aristotle Unmoved Mover argument
Basically everything in the universe is in constant motion right down to atoms themselves vibrating in place
Objects do move unless some other object moves this is echoed by Newton second law of motion
Something therefore must have all the motion in the universe
We know now that the Big Bang started all motion in the universe but what existed before the Big Bang
As far as we can guess since matter can be neither created nor destroyed we believe that all matter in the universe was spread evenly throughout space until started to cause that matter to coalesce into the singularity that would become the Big Bang
If you look back through time far enough something had to have moved without having moved itself
This is what Aristotle called the unmoved mover and deemed evidence of some form of higher power

Less nasty comments more dorky I hope she having a good day she so beautiful I would die for her Like of course there are also creepy lesbians as there are creepy people in all demographics but if you spend your time in gay circles you notice a lot more introspection especially from people who have spent their whole lives being objectified themselves

damn this will get buried but I ended up on a date with a guy who turned out to be a Wiccan
He told me a story about wanting to hurt his ex girlfriend and he kept referring to her as babe
Babe and him went on a spiritual journey together and visited some spiritually significant places
Upon standing in one location he started to feel very strange and aggressive
When they got back to the hotel babe asked if he was feeling ok and he said no babe I really feel like I need to hurt you right now
When I asked if he ended up hurting her he said No

If you do mind me saying though some people particularly Americans have this view of NZ as some kind of paradise and it really is
It just an ordinary country with some serious issues to grapple with such as the highest youth suicide rate in the developed world obesity and child abuse on a level with the US growing inequality and a housing crisis that the UN calls a human rights issue

I used to live in Southern Africa and we did charity work in a lot of very remote rural areas and when I say remote I mean several hours rough driving on roads that can barely be called roads
Many times we would come across settlements that were not on any map just a collection of cinderblock and mud houses sometimes well off the road
Usually these were what we called working villages as in there is some worksite maybe a small brickwork or farm or something like that nearby though when I say near the workers could be walking an hour or so to where they need to be
When we would stumble upon places like this we would stop find coordinates and landmarks make some records and pass it along back to our office
One day we are working in the area near the borders of South Africa Namibia and Botswana and we see some smoke well off the road
Thinking it may be a village we decide to go off road to take a look
It was fairly well hidden behind a small hill and from the road you would have never known it was there if it were not for the column of smoke on the horizon
We get to it and sure enough it looks like one of these unmarked working villages maybe or so huts but something seemed very off
It took a second and we realized that there was no one around and yet it seemed as if whoever lived there was there only moments before
We head to where the smoke came from and it was a large bonfire when we looked closer we noticed bones in it goat and cattle bones
Other than the sound of the fire there was not a peep from anything else
Once I stepped out of our truck to get a closer look I had this overwhelming sense that I was being watched from afar and that I was not welcomed here
The other guys in the truck said they felt the same and that we needed to go
So we did
A couple of weeks later when we were driving back curiosity got the better of me and I decided I wanted to check the site again
This time however the village was stripped bare
Anything that could be taken was gone
All that was left was the shells of the huts and a black patch of ash where the fire was
There was one thing that was still there though the sense of being watched
We did stay any longer and never went back

Went on a date with a guy who on the date told me he questioning his sexuality and has started putting the moves on his straight roommate just seeing how far he can push things before he says stop
So you sexually harassing your roommate

Gonzo pours milk for Hans Landa as he monologues But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast it would be that of the The camera pans through the floor boards where a silent Rizzo the Rat sits nervously
Muppet Hitler burns
Jim Henson probably already has one of those lying around
Jellied eels
Pretty creepy indeed especially because it made physical contact with you
I will save this remedy for an after work relaxation on a hot summer day
Or maybe winter
Watch Quinten Tarantino s Hateful
There is a scene where Kurt Russel improv d destroying a guitar
He thought it was a prop but it hasn t been exchanged yet
He destroys a real s Martin he didn t realize until later but the actress he took the guitar from new it was the antique
Saw
Obligatory not a lesbian but I would imagine that some do just like some men do
But not all men objectify women and I doubt all lesbians objectify women
As far as how one would justify demeaning a woman I suppose in the same way that someone justifies demeaning anyone
That is to say that they do really view that person as a person which excuses them from the responsibility of treating them like a person
I not say that these things are right to do obviously but some people do think this way
Any Robin Williams movie keep him
John Wick keep Keanu that would be hilarious
The room
Tommy Viseau with a bunch of muppets
It would not really deviate from the plot
that much
I not disagreeing with you on that but society is overly sensitive these days and the vast majority of the populace is unable to think for themselves
Political correctness was instituted by media and government to think for the people and tell the overly sensitive people how they should feel about words and labels among other things no matter if their version is factually accurate
I loathe political correctness but the views I have expressed in this topic have been solely tied to the topic question for the sake of neutrality in hopes of invoking critical thinking from all perspectives
Turning right
A place of my own not with family basically so I can give my homeless friend a place to stay where she does have to worry about creepy guys wanting sex in exchange for a place to stay
Let down toots and the Maytals
There is a scientific thing called the sexy son hypothesis
It sounds horrendously red pill but it does have some backing
Basically comes down to the asymmetry that a woman takes a year to grow and push out one baby while a super hot dude can knock up a dozen chicks in that time
If the ovarian imperative is to have lots of grandchildren then this means women are likely to fall for hot dudes and try to raise equally hot dudes from any resulting male children
Thus the clones
Does sound a bit incel but when you think about the kind of man with multiple child support arrangements they re never scrawny accountants
John Wick
Keep Keanu and everyone else is a muppet
High stakes action comedy ensues
Being an adult sucks pretty hard
But I also love
Lot about it
I miss being carefree as a teen
Having is super easy in school
College is hard
But once an adult i have a new relationship with my parents in whole new way
They are of course still parents but theres a new form of respect
Being treated like a responsible adult is probably one of the best feelings
Being able to have a level conversion with adults and not being talking down to or pushed aside is pretty awesome
Being able to make my own decisions is dope too
But being a teen was so much fun
I knew I was safe and with the freedom I did have it was enough for me
So I guess its how you look at it
I enjoy my parents and other adults respecting my opinions and decisions but I do miss the safety and comfort of being a teen
Now you need to be respectful and responsible around her if you want decent grades
But she seem super intelligent
I think most of her students learn much more from her than just mathematical analysis
I was with some friends when my sister called me saying that my dog had passed
Steak
side note state sunder lockdown this older lady is fucking touching all the bannanas to count them
Like one or two fingers going one two three then going no not enough and touching more of them

She gave me a look like i just ruined whatever count she was on

You have to take back your BMW by beating other people with fast cars
I do know why this guy entertaining you You making up shit to comfort yourself and not change your current behaviour You said yourself that farming is lucrative do you think there enough of these magical friendly little farms to supply the amount of chicken and beef people consume everyday
Have you ever been to a McDonalds
Killing the animals is inherently cruel you do need to throw them against walls or beat them
If policemen slit their dog throats after three years because they were as spry would you be making your stupid hey they did it as humanely as possible the dog was looking the other way argument

What We Do in the Shadows
I keeping Stu the rest are muppets
Yea thats a brutal one
When it comes to keeping together and showing love we actually took the love languages test https and it has been extremely helpful in making up the difference
For example along with physical touch for me words of affirmation is something that helps make up the gaps in feeling affection and love
That something that she is able to do more regularly
Now for her her love language is acts of service
So me doing that keeps her feeling satisfied and loved

Cleaning up around the house doing dishes without being asked etc
Now for purely the I really want to nut in you because we have in a while part communication is the key but also patience is necessary with some partners
To help with that my wife and I actually made several sex videos together and she totally does mind that I jerk it to those
Maybe its weird but it works for me when i super horny and she just is
I would prefer to do it that way

Nick Cage still plays Big Daddy
A human trains a young Muppet girl to be a badass vigilante to kill insane criminal muppets
He goes on a weeks long killing spree with this muppet
Finally he s captured and tortured by the muppets culminating with them burning him to death
Currently the pandemic
Usually it the fear of failing and embarrassment and the fact that I stuggle to communicate and ask for help that hold me back
Thats glad to hear Stay safe
Can t forget Charlie and Mary Jane
They are terrifying as is
Their tendrils can mesure up to feet swaying almost invisible in the currents

My husband and i are truck drivers and i dont like missing out on so much but i dont wan na just quit bc i kno there isnt any better jobs except driving local and all the local companies in my area dont pay shit so yea if i could afford it id stay at home
Maybe also get the money to go visit my parents once in a while
Actually this is the biggest reason I believe it was a higher entity as well that started the Big Bang
Of course I can t prove it
But it makes the most logical sense
Of course science could potentially find new data that could change this theory
But as of right now we don t have any credible evidence
The Helium Song Leave That Pillow Where It Is
Opposite of not good
Female communication is heavily influenced by two things
We aren t forced to be stoic and unmoved by basic emotions so it s more socially acceptable for us to elaborate and use more etc
We re also socialised to not cause a fuss to be likeable and agreeable and to be the one who doesn t rock the boat
This is as unrealistic as telling men to be stoic all the time
Some days women will be angry or annoyed and trying to remain when you don t feel those two things is very difficult
So then angry venting and confessing becomes so it doesn t rock the boat
But as we all know gossiping or talking underhandedly never ends well
So secret or layered talk becomes the norm since women are told we can t be anything but on surface
John Wick
Keanu Reeves just laying down the law on this Muppet underworld
When you can always always just be yourself And they can too
They re the same person only one person isn t a muppet
You get both
I always get tonic and lime in a rocks glass because then no one bugs me
If a guy asks to buy me a drink that what I order but I go with him to the bar
Always just say oh man I had too much already but let talk

my alcoholic boss drinking whisky from the bottle
I know but is there really need to not show a price that doesn t include tax

That sounds like something that should be getting quite popular around the world right now
Considering I might kick the bucket in the pandemic
I would like to try that better to have loved and lost business
Also being sawn in half looks pretty metal from all the dark age drawings but I think I pass
Instead I think I give waxing my butt a try I want to remember what it was like to not have dingle berries again
Five nights at freddy s fan art
I think my purpose was honestly to learn to let go
I do have to control everything
My only responsibility is to be right here right now

Why would someone hire someone random off the Internet

My brother had the genius idea of freezing my dad toothbrush in a glass of water
In the evening He took it out of the freezer to place it in the bathroom
My mom knew about it and started smiling
When my brother walked away I took his frozen toothbrush out of the freezer and placed it in his bathroom
My mom died laughing
t dr I think my prank was pretty funny
He is resting for now
Marla should stay human
Why are so many women so pissed with manspreading when some of them take up a whole bus seat with their purse and become the same as if not WORSE than manspreading

It was great
Either help me get my crush or move on from crush
It a laser pointer is it
I lived within a vagina for years hiding and biding my time until the day when I was strong enough to venture into the outside world
Finally prepared I took part in a nine month journey to the surface world
The closer I got the more cryptic the messages on the walls of the cavern became
Eldtrich tracts scrawled in unspeakable tongues with a viscous white fluid adorned the walls all around me
Had I remained in there one month longer I not sure if my sanity would have survived
Has it survived
Even now the voices haunt me part of me will forever reside in those tunnels of love
Never said I was mad at them
I just dont understand the whole thing
I would want the truth
My choice does matter
I would want to know if there is or is which one s what is it are and what powers or constraints there are
Children of Men
And the best part about all the intensity and action is that it s not a stupid action film

Do worry I wo rape you
I a little boy
We don t have his tax returns
Feel free to source that claim
OK if you want to be absolutely pedantic we do have of his tax returns but several have been leaked
Including by Rachel Maddow in a massive nothingburger
However his earnings were reported to the FEC which are correlated against the returns the IRS has meaning they are strictly public but the constituent data has been verified which is what required by law
That means his income sources have been verified as well as the amounts
I think all politicians should be held accountable for bad behavior including Democrats
That is partly why I am not a huge fan of either Biden or the Clintons
Bill Clinton in particular got away with a ton of shit that would never fly today and it pisses me off that Democrats still won t acknowledge it
Yeah well I find it rather interesting that republicans get disavowed when they been caught doing illegal shit and charged often to draconian degrees while Democrats just get let off with a warning
You do think that looks rather like preferential treatment indicative of a totaly corrupt party using it position and hold in the government for mutual personal enrichment and protection from prosecution
However Trump is historically bad and historically incompetent
In what way
He resisted multiple attempts to drag us into foreign wars in the middle east which the MSM was egging on along with the Dems
He targeted and killed the leader of ISIS Austere Religious Scholar as the MSM put it and Solimani the Iranian Hero who responsible for killing hundreds of US servicemen and who killed thousands of his own people for protesting using surgical strikes seen the Caliphate totaly destroyed from an entity that had taken over most of countries put a stop to Obama era indiscriminate drone bombing and extrajudicial killing of American citizens
The economy was doing historically great until China screwed the pooch with lower than unemployment
Speaking of which while the democrats were emceeing their Impeachment dog and pony show Trump was setting up the Coronavirus task force and shutting down travel from China which the Democrats in general and their presidential candidate called racist and xenophobic as recently as weeks ago
Nancy Pelosi claims they were all very aware of it but did nor said fuckall about it
In fact she tore up the state of the union speech where he talked about it
Also he tried to send CDC observers to China and they were refused what was he supposed to do cleanse the area with nuclear fire
Given the available choices now and years ago I say he was the better choice

You called the entire Japanese race an asshole Chief
i was with my girlfriend talking over discord

The closet is feet away from his bed and as i said earlier everyone asleep
A moment later theres a flash of light and a thump from outside
i still dont know what happened also once at am there was a car that drove down my street parked in front of MY HOUSE for like minutes then reversed i knew it was reversing bc i could see the front headlights all the way up my street

Teehee
As a guy who is' I have no problem asking for help
If I incapable of doing something I can admit it
If the thing I need help with is a particular skill I will watch the one helping me so I can learn how to do it myself if I am alone I tinker until I find what works properly
I always told people that you ca discredit someone from not knowing something because the odds are that they have simply never been taught that thing
Ca blame them for what they do know
In my opinion chosen ignorance is weakness asking for help is human and you build a sense of community with people when they walk you through things
The wonder of it all
My mom made an album when I was a little girl
Everytime I hear her sing it bring me to tears

My sister and I got into a huge fight because we were both on ellipticals at the gym and they showed our heart rates were over bpm
My sister said the machines were broken because heart rates ca go over
I said I thought that was wrong but she wanted to switch ellipticals
So we switched and sure enough our heart rates are still over
She says those readers are broken too
This was before smart phones
By the time we got back to the house and I could Google and show her she was wrong the fight had devolved so far from that topic it did matter and she did care

Why guys will pay for sex when masturbation is free and effective
The fact that I isolated myself during my
I did date I did travel much basically just stayed at home reading watching tv shows and eating
I kind of feel that I started to live again at
I feel like I have missed so many aspects and experiences in my life
I was watching a YouTube video around Christmas time as my mom was hanging up lights around my bunk bed about the most disturbing videos on the web
The first video was about two frogs
Their home was being destroyed so they moved under a tree trunk
Somebody probably a farmer reached his hand in and one of the frogs got a sewing needle and scratched his hand with it
It ended with the frogs somehow being caked in and dying
The second video was a dude who looked like Leatherface
In it he chases a boy who for some reason looks like Tom Holland around in a creepy abandoned building
Tom Holland eventually dies at the hand of Leatherface and his chainsaw
I almost vividly remember his eyes as he laid dead
Creepy shit
The last video is the one I remember best
In it a nice looking Asian lady has an orange tabby kitten
She s surfing the web and keeps looking at the kitten
Later she goes to a party bringing the kitten for reasons that weren t specified in the dream
She s drinking and having a good time
Then she gets this cold emotionless look on her face
She walks over to the kitten with her white flats and just stomps on the kitten as hard as she can
The kitten is now only a pool of blood with fur around it
It looked like a pancake
Everybody freezes then runs out of the house in a frenzy
She calmly walks out and starts getting tears in her eyes
She shouts run run With a wobble in her voice and she starts sobbing
After that I woke up and promptly tried to search for that compilation video at in the morning
Didn t find it but the dream freaked the fuck out of me nonetheless
You are a lucky person I hope you get more yummy dinners and Church time with that person
I didn t realize how miserable my job was making me until the day after the stay at home order
My mood and motivation increased tenfold thinking I don t have to go back there for days
That tracks
Half baked and Dave Chapelle stays
As a bi guy I feel this
My boyfriend is shorter than me but sometimes I try to be shorter because I feel safer if I feel like he taller than me
Why some men and women do this too view women as some totally alternate species and seemingly forget how to interact with them as human beings and instead prop them up in some alternate dimension where the norms of talking to people don t apply for some reason
Like women are mystical beings yet to be fully understood
I will preface that my husband and I did not wait for marriage but we are the only person either of us has ever been with
I think ensuring sexual compatibility is important
The only pro I ve seen others say so far is that there s virtually no risk of STDs but the same is true for just having a single partner you don t to be married for that
And on the plus side if it doesn t work out you re not married to them

As a guy who is' I have no problem asking for help
If I incapable of doing something I can admit it
If the thing I need help with is a particular skill I will watch the one helping me so I can learn how to do it myself if I am alone I tinker until I find what works properly
I always told people that you ca discredit someone from not knowing something because the odds are that they have simply never been taught that thing
Ca blame them for what they do know
In my opinion chosen ignorance is weakness asking for help is human and you build a sense of community with people when they walk you through things

HMO only allows fills at HMO pharmacies
Everyone I know with a car is also high risk elderly medically compromised small kids at home etc
I don t know if I would need to be present with my ID to use the HMO pharmacy
I am less concerned for myself ADHD meds are important but I won t die without them than for someone like a cancer patient on scheduled pain meds
I think a global pandemic with might be grounds to petition for meds to be legal to ship
If someone has been on the same dose of something for over a decade with no early fills or red flags it should be legal to mail them their meds
Again for this is an inconvenience
I posted to get input from smarter people on Reddit about solving to something that seems to me to be an actual problem that might not be on anyone s radar

Must admit the age when I thought this would be cool vs the age when I could actually afford a car any car in fact that made a noise like this has allowed me to grow old enough to realise it is fair to subject people to that
it is because you want to show off
I never got this
It like the way stuff aimed at kids says smoking is cool kids

I ll definitely look into it
A religion usually believes in a belief in something or a principle of things
Usually detailed texts with doctrines and philosophy which often addresses codes of conduct morality where we come from etc
Ritual follows from that
A congregation then follows from that
Superstition is usually a one off isolated belief or a multiple idea that may lead to a ritual
Doesn t lead to a congregation doesn t address more complex ideas that religion does
For example believing that is unlucky does not lead to a person having a moral code
Charles Bronson executing Muppets while raising the particularly sexy one as a protege would be pretty awesome

You are a very normal human being then unless you did something so weird that you creeper out a whole bunch of people
I disagree but if you do care what God cares about then I do think one wrong thing is worse than another
Sex before marriage is just as bad as lying or stealing or disobeying parents it just another of the ten commandments

Apparently we creep people out in more ways than one
We have been told from early childhood we have a creepy smile and laugh
As we got older this turned to people claiming we seemed to have a scary personality as well

genital mutilation is minor physical abuse
it emotional abuse in that they telling you that your body is dirty ugly and something you should be ashamed of
infant genital cutting is the epitome of forcing your belief on others
it not part of raising a family
a loving parent would mutilate their child body
Horrible
Using an excuse such as that to intentionally make the game stressful is an shit move
But now if your character is put into a moral situation where there an option that would match his alignment while the other would then I think it fine

I was making a joke about how the phrasing of your reply would be awkward if OP addiction was masturbation
As usual I made a joke which I thought was hilarious albeit immature but it failed to launch
The seen from Texas Chainsaw Massacre when the killer puts a girl on a meat hook
I saw it at a museum going through a horror movie exhibit when I was about
The thought of a hook ripping through a person like that while they re still alive it took me a long time to get that imagery out of my head
Never saw any the movie that scene was enough
I saw a lot of it in the for some reason which was weird because I did roll with that crowd at all
I could sing pretty well

Went out on a date with this girl on a thursday
She was pretty good looking and seemed nice over text
so i get to her house to pick her up and her two sister walk out with her and get in the car and i was WTFF
Anyway i didnt wana be rude so we all of us
drive to this spot to hangout and about n drinks in she starts breaking down about her ex like literally crying
At this point i already wanted to leg it and drive off but i figured i wouldnt be fast
so i just sit there in silence the whole time while shes crying then not crying then crying again
So finally she wants to head back after of the worst hours of my life so i drive her back to hers her sisters get out
She stays says thanks for listening and sorry for a bad date
im like its cool shit happens
Then she fully grabs me n kisses me obvs not gona miss this so we start making out she invites me into her room
we start havin sex and her phones goin off the entire time and shes just ignoring it
so about an hour later she finally looks at her phone and straight away tells me that i shud leave
i was like oh im getting my shit she says we dont have time for this because her ex who just got out of prison is on his way here and hes gona be here any minute now so i rush the fuck out of there no shoes on n everything right past her dad sitting in the living room watching straight into my car n im gone

I been feeling really insecure lately and I have two things on my mind that are really stressing me out because I do know how to deal with them
For the past couple of months I say around February someone I considered one of my closest friends has made me extremely uncomfortable whenever I around them
I feel like I need a break from the friendship but I do know how to tell her or if I can
I do have the heart to and it make her upset and drama will start
Knowing her boyfriend he going to verbally harass me for doing that and that make it even worse
I have another' who constantly degrades me
She even once told me that I deserve to die and she deserves to live because she deserves life more than I do
She crossed the line and I finally realized that I need to get her out of my life and I gaining the courage to stand up to her but in the end she going to make herself the victim and make me look like the bad guy
I want to distance myself from two people but if I stand up to them and say something the situation will only get worse
They also both have boyfriends and the first friend I mentioned gushes about her boyfriend
She wo hesitate to let know that she is single and almost every conversation turns into something about him
Whenever she starts talking about him it reminds me that things are going to well between me and this other person and it makes me feel sad and very insecure when she starts talking about her boyfriend
I not going to tell her to stop though because my sadness should stop her from talking about something that makes her happy but I only end up hurting myself more
I sorry this is so long but I just needed to get this out because I feel like there not many people I know that I would feel comfortable telling or would want to hear it anyway

Action stars playing themselves in a role where they actually need to uses the skills they portray in movies together to survive
Demons and Satan are real and are controlling every facet of our culture and world through possession of certain people in positions of power to further the new world order
God is real and his Kid Jesus came to set us free from this shithead planet
Satan showed Him all the kingdoms on earth and said they could be his if he would worship him
Jesus was a rebel and always resisted crooked authority and religious leaders
He was hated and mocked and still submitted
He had everything and nothing
He was not the prince of THIS world that prince is Satan
That prince corrupted the early church
That prince has been offering the kingdoms of the earth in exchange for souls since the beginning
What if everything you have heard and mock is actually true
What if this Lil plague is just the beginning
What if a bunch of people who are haters calling themselves Christians do even know God at all and the true church is already hidden away
What if the most important powerful people pulling the strings making the cash including mega pastors are in fact inhabited by the devil most powerful minions
For now we see through the glass darkly it wo always be that way

One at a time repetition makes me bored
I remembered how to make that part so subsequent times went far quicker
Yeah I had a similar situation except I didnt get caught or realize it until after the fact
About years ago I was arrested for DWI and along with possession charges
I only blew a but I was Xaned the fuck out one of the or so times I did Xanax and not a single one of those nights ended well or were even fun and I should not have been driving
I only remember bits and pieces of the traffic stop and the booking process but basically I was probably the most cooperative arrest in a situation like that they ever hard
Because of the Xanax I just did give a fuck and was pretty much like well you got me
I definitely should have been driving
That attitude actually saved my ass
Because they were EXTREMELY lax in their search of me and I assume my car I do remember seeing them search the car Because I told them I had a bowl and they ended up finding a mg I believe it was the peaches and not a
football
I was charged with possession but they left of the Xans I had in my cig pack in there and took and charged me with it
Idk if it was intentional but the cig pack was laying on my passenger seat when I got my car out of impound the next day
It was winter so I had a big jacket on
And in one of the side pockets I had an open bag of weed
Just a half gram or around that
I also had a closed Gran bag in another pocket
While in the back of the cop car in cuffs while the officers searches or talked or something I managed to pull the gram out of jacket and shove it into my pants
Still to this day im not entirely sure how I managed that and how they did see me maybe they did and just did care
After I got to jail It was like in the morning but I was fortunate enough to be left in the holding cell until I was bonded out by some friends around in the morning
I was never stripped because I never got sent back to the actual jail
Just stayed in the holding cell in the booking area
I know I was getting close to them sending me back though
When I got my jacket and stuff back as I was leaving jail I still had the weed in my pocket and then I remembered having the weed in my pants at that Time too
It was a crazy night and one in which I got VERY lucky

Logan I keep high Jackman Stuffing everywhere

Depends on each race and how it organized
Usually the start is downtown or somewhere that the people in the town can easily get to with the stages out of town enough to not bother people
For the record I against those dickheads doing in a zone probably more than most people in my demographic
However most people who do serious racing events are more respectful than them and try to drive their racecar when near people
Fast and loud cars are kinda like guns some people should definitely not be using them like they are and those people are making the good people who enjoy their toys safely and respectfully look bad

Back in the there was a AM radio station I listened to
WJMX
And every day around sunset the station would go off the air most of the time in the middle of a song
I do know why I was thinking about that but I decided to look it up
FCC rules stated that my station which transmitted at watts had to cut power to watts after the sun went down
Without the suns energy the ionosphere would reflect the AM radio waves thousands of miles and interfere with countless other radio stations

Oh this reminds of a time we had someone show up to an interview with their mother
This was an adult man in his applying to work at a social work agency

She tried to get back in the elevator
We had to escort her back

We also share the longest boarder and even Andrew Jackson our trademark asshole president managed to keep good relations with Canada
For some fucked up reason just because Trump mad at Trudeau his gang of dumb rednecks actually think Canada is an enemy

Add toast pancakes or waffles if you are more hungry
I have heard arguments but it a sandwich to me
Maybe technically it something else but if there bread holding something within it it a sandwich
Some argue since it is two piece of sperated bread it does count so maybe it more of a sub sandwich or another subcategory but it falls under sandwich regardless
Vanilla with chocolate syrup
The best of both worlds
God I hate the eggs
I want fish
Oh well your right maybe I can make something cool
Smoke weed
This one was born into a very very poor family built oneself up to be moderately middle class
Through all the hardships pain struggles and syrup sandwiches weed was always there
One can remember break ups and birthdays
Times when rent was gon na be impossible to make and when times where one learns ones maternal parent electronically paid ones rent on the day one was gon na pay rent and now has cash for the month
Through all of the good times and bad come ups and let downs
Weed has always helped me get through and make it out of where I begun
And with luck my son will pick up the mantle and rise us above from where I leave us
And if he is anything like me weed will be there for him aswell

Dnd starter set
Dogville and keep Nichole Kidman
I was a homeschooled kid who did have any friends my own age growing up to hang out with so I would spend my time watching alot of anime and reading alot of manga plus playing video games I never thought it was a big deal until I became a teenager then my parents who never paid attention to me or my interests before suddenly decided my interests were normal in mocked and humiliated me daily for it
saying things like one around here cares about these things' and one wants to be friends with an outcast' calling my manga baby books and refusing to let me buy them anymore
going on about how no one my age still plays video games and telling me to grow up act my age even though I was only
it was none stop finally I snapped and just bagged all my up in a garbage bag and threw them in my closet because looking at them anymore just pissed me off hell
even after doing that they still harassed me for my old hobbies especially when I started showing signs of depression saying that anime was what was causing me to feel that way even though at that point I had completely stopped watching it

Really sad
Not very often
I cried a couple days ago and was quite sad
I bought a stuffed Easter bunny for my little niece
Then I brought it home and thought damn I better disinfect this thing because it could get her sick
That was somehow very sad to me because it pointed out just how much things have changed so suddenly
I would never have thought about that before though having given it more thought I probably should have always been doing this
But at the time it made me sad
At least every day if not multiple times a day
From the streets she emerged And to the streets she will return And I say unto you is for the So be not weary when she must return from whence she came

After a huge brawl between most of the black kids our principal had this long drawn out speech over the PA system that we had to listen to
Somewhere in her rambling speech she said instead of fighting we should plant flowers So the last week of class an unknown group came at night and built a huge foot frame around her parking spot and filled it with yards of dirt and planted flowers in it
Kinda corny The year after reorganized the graduation chairs into the shape of a penis
We get a flower bed
Huh interesting
I ve found it to be incredibly efficient at conveying emotion and vulnerability and it s often brought me closer to people as a result
I think it s fascinating that others view it as bad

Neighbor s adult son ran a stolen vehicle and chop shop ring in a shared driveway that we both owned

blue pepsi
Force awakens and Kylo is the only human
Ok so
Most likely
It not gon na benefit you too much to wait
What really matters is why you want to wait if you do
I seen it work out well and I seen it go horrendously wrong
I do really know how to quantify the pros of waiting beyond possible moral and emotional levels
It worked out great for a lot of people I know and I can tell you for certain one couple that did so is still together and still doing it more than years later
They are happy with their decision and there are lost of similar stories out there
The cons are perhaps much easier to list because I seen much more instances of when it goes wrong
A lot of the people I know who waited for religious or moral reasons felt extreme guilt over any physical contact with their partner even when certain they would marry them and that guilt did stop even after they got married
Many were uncomfortable with nakedness their own or other people and we not certain how to handle their own feelings of sexual desire
I taught far too many people the basics of sex Ed and how to have sex most comfortably and safely because they were never taught it but were expected to perform on their wedding night
Several people have struggled for years with it whether from the emotional toll of trying to move past a solidified ideology they carried their entire lives or dealing with physical problems they did and could have known existed because they never had sexual experience vaginismus and early onset erectile dysfunction being some of the most common
Bottom line it your body
You choose what you want to do with it
If your want to wait go for it
I support you
Just make sure that is what you want for you and that you decide to have sex you are ready for it physically and emotionally
If you want someone to talk to privately about it feel free to message me
I taught a lot of sex Ed classes and counseled a number of relationships so I can provide at least an academic point of view if not an emotional one from experience
Also I just willing to listen if you need a void to rant to that answers back sometimes
You be Good luck out there

I own most of my homes outright luckily so I told them to pay what they they can and not to worry about it too much
Even if I was a heartless greedy prick I still be lenient on rent right now
Vacancies in rental homes are expensive clean up and remodeling usually occurs new appliances posting vacant ads etc and during a national crisis they would be exposed to
The only logical and the only Human thing to do is be lenient
Jus my cents
Drop acid again
LOTS of acid
I done something similar too
I was walking through town during peak hour after work and came across a teenage girl who had emptied out her whole duffle bag on the busy footpath
I think she had torrets syndrome or something because she kept hitting herself in the head in a way like she was punishing herself for being stupid
Everyone was looking at her like she was a psycho but no one was helping
I approached her and asked her if she was ok
Turns out she had lost her bus card and was trying to find it in her bag but her ticks were letting her logically think about the situation
So we packed up her bag went to the bank so I could give her some cash to get home on the bus and walked her to her dance class
First time I told this story as I too have wanted to come across as bragging
The next few years are going to be really tough but you ll also have some of your happiest times and meet some amazing people

I was maybe when this happened
I woke up to a strange noise coming from the doorway to my bedroom
I could sense someone walking towards me but couldn t move or see
When the footsteps stopped next to my bed I could feel fingers digging at my ribs
I started laughing and it stopped
The footsteps went out of my room again and my eyes opened to pure darkness
I could barely see anything in the room
When I walked over and turned on the lights I thought I could see imprints in the carpet where feet had recently been
They went out my room and down the hall before disappearing
I don t think I slept for the rest of the night
That was over years ago and I still remember every detail about it
That happens all the time here in NY now

Stop demonising people with a mental disorder that is often caused by traumatic abuse by equating abusive and dangerous behaviour with their health condition
And stop acting like only mentally ill people can be abusive and dangerous
Neither of these actually help keep anyone safe and can actually cause real harm to innocent people

A new life
It was one of the best sex I ever had
I was had few sexual experiences but was never comfortable enough to have sex fully
It felt either forced or I was turned on enough
But this one night I met this guy we were both extremely attracted to each other when we met we drank some wine and talked for about an hour or two
As I was about to leave he kissed me and I felt that vibrating feeling rushing through me and I ended up taking him back to my place
It was magical

My fear is actually that Pence is probably extremely electable among Republicans
He looks presidential and has the name recognition to soothe moderate Republicans and he s a darling for the evangelicals

He makes me extremely nervous

The only person I have heard that story from was my dad but everyone he worked with back then claims it true

It s because we all absorb the same toxic message about ideal body types
The skinny girls aren t being told they re ok or that they don t have to listen to these messages
They absorb the same things anyone else does so they end up with the same low self esteem too
None of us are exempt from being body shamed by media and corporations designed to make us feel like we need to be constantly changing or improving upon our appearance
Think about it when another billion dollar company releases yet another product designed to somehow change your current state into something better receiving that message your whole life tells you that you as you are right now is not good enough
You need to be moving toward your self made possible by using their product
If you absorb that message from childhood you can be the ideal and not feel like it at all because you re not evolving toward something better
It s fucked and takes years to unlearn

Avengers Infinity War the only normal one is Thanos
Think about all my flaws
Not me but a friend
Not her first Tinder rodeo but her first time meeting a guy at a hotel
She rang me before she went to let me know where she would be in case anything went wrong
So they re in the hotel room things are progressing everything is going well
The lights are off but there s a little light coming in from the curtains
The guy flips her over and they re going at it from behind
Anyway he says I didn t notice you had a lower back My friend says I don Huh weird right
So he gets up and turns the light on and there is blood EVERYWHERE
Neither of them is sure where it came from
My friend s hooha is filled with blood and she runs to the shower thinking her period must have come early and all at once apparently
Poor guy is nursing his old fella and realises he has torn the piece of skin that attaches the foreskin to the shaft
For some unknown reason he didn t notice because it didn t hurt
My friend cleaned herself up put her clothes back on left the hotel and called me from the car
Never heard from him again but has seen his profile on Tinder since so it s assumed he didn t bleed to death after she left
Harry potter voldemort the actor the rest puppets
The first one is kind of difficult in her defense
In person the people you meet can see your personality and look past the handicap but with the barrier of the internet you ai getting that far
I met a guy online who was smokin' hot funny as hell and when he told me he was handicapped later in the conversation I considered not showing up because I was sure I could deal with it
Pushed through it anyway because he was so cool
It took me a few weeks to get passed it and then suddenly it became something I loved about him
They were part of him and he was the man I loved
I would have never found that out if I known from the
That said this girl was a nutcase otherwise and OP should have nope out at the tattoo
Street Fighter
I m scared this is developing within me too
This probably seems mundane to you but I ve noticed that recently this year I ve been waking up SCREAMING bloody murder and shouting please please stop because I m dreaming that there s hundreds of cockroaches or spiders crawling all over me
It seems so real
When my boyfriend finally manages to shake me awake I m always so surprised and often embarrassed that it was only a just because of how vivid it is
Innagaddadavida

My multiple sources are fine as the articles provide solid rational justification statics and facts that are often derived from government data for their basis
To try and placate your earlier request for sources I provided articles from various sites so as to not seem biased
Yet I guess that was enough
I do see much point in continuing this further as you attack factual statistics when presented with them
I doubt we will agree upon this as we seem to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum or at least in regards to our leader
Wash your hands and stay safe bud

They might choose to be gay because despite being aroused by both genders the opposite gender could have left some bad memories
Often times though there are no advantages to being gay especially in schools in this day and age

There are so many more things I could say about her but that will always stick out to me as a hallmark of her selflessness and badassery
This is my favorite one

I never been taught how to investigate this kind of thing it almost never happens
and was told I was allowed to involve anyone including anyone who could help me to preserve the employees privacy in case we were wrong
We were wrong and I think I did a bloody good job
I want my family to think of when I came out to them

I was raised in a cult and stayed with it until age
Then while researching on the internet I came across some shocking information about the cult
I bought a book about it and read it in one evening
By the time I finished the book I realized everything I believed in was a lie and my life had been wasted up to then
Yea but only becuase I in it

I been buying sex since I was I now

Because I like the thrill of it as much as the sex
It feels risky and dirty and you never know what might happen
The experience varies from girl to girl so much so that price is not a good indicator of how good the session will be

Toilet paper hoarding should count
The Martian keep Matt Damon
No one out here is saying you HAVE to watch milf stuff tho like there plenty of stuff in between teen and milf
All I saying is stuff like Dad has sex with tiny young teen baby sitter is pretty disgusting there no reason to think someone would use a title like that with any other intent than trying to insinuate to the viewer you should imagine the actress here is underage'
Like I get if you younger yourself you wan na look at someone who looks closer to your own age but a lot of if not most young and teen porn is specifically curated towards dudes who are out of that age range
Why else do you think so many actresses in teen porn are paired with older looking guys
Why do you think actresses who are freshly or barely legal is such a big thing in porn which is gross in itself but a different conversation
Pedophile culture if you wan na call it that has a huge hold on the porn industry and its fucked up that all I saying
They probably wrapped the PMI into the rate
I ve never heard of banks waiving PMI
Do do porn but I watch the misfits podcast I recommend it
They had Mia Malkova on as a guest and she said that her work and relationships were separate

It the same thing we seen for a dozen seasons already
The character is fine and I like that they created the multiverse I just have no desire to do anything other than read synopsis every couple years
That not exactly what reading people is if people try to be mind readers then yes they wrong
Reading people is more about intuition and it a skill like anything else that can be developed
The distinction is kind of like this you can tell when someone is lying or has an agenda but just because you know it a lot does mean you know the truth
Just because you can tell they have an agenda does mean you know the agenda
And yes sometimes you be wrong which is why you seldom act on it
In poker you can tell he is in the bottom end of his range after a VPIP of in mid position that does mean you know the exact threshold of his range you adjust your play accordingly
Human behavior is consistent in most individuals but you need to establish your baseline
You ca just read minds
You just learn a large percentage of variables and constants in an individual through perception and observation then from there you can notice deviations
Big difference from knowing what they thinking
I a white male who been locked up on the east coast and then got an entry level job at a bank and worked my way up to investigating financial crimes where for hours a week I had to listen to people lie on recordings and watch videos from various merchants of them being there doing the crime while talking to them on phone trying to convince me otherwise
I am luckily no longer in that LoB but just know that with this experience I would like to think I at least a little better at reading people than I be otherwise
You right btw I wrong sometimes
It still a valid skill
Battle Hymn of the Republic

Because one is a stills camera that uses a high powered flash to capture a single image of a subject that is literally on rails and strapped in place once every few minutes for a few hours a day for a few months a year
Images that are most often deleted within an hour of being taken
The other is a video camera that has to capture frames a second of a wide area hours a day all year round even while the place is shut
Footage that has to be stored for a considerable amount of time afterwards

Anybody want a peanut
I was bored while visiting my brother In California so I decided to download the app and see what happened
Matched with a guy we agree to grab drinks we get drunk and he s like want to go on an adventure I say sure
Dude orders an Uber to Palm Springs we were in Newport Beach that s two hours away
So here we go off to Palm Springs
We get to the hotel and start wandering around end up at a gay bar where he meets a guy and decides it s a good idea to go to his hotel
The guy gives him what he thought was coke but it was actually meth so here I am with a guy I ve known like hours he s fucked up yelling in the streets
We go to the hotel and I go to bed
Next day we go gamble all day and get drunk again he s at the casino giving everyone money being crazy
We go back to the hotel pool and he s buying a whole bachelorette party bottles of champagne being crazy again
I m now like ok I m out I say I m getting an Uber back to Newport and he goes you re not leaving I m calling the cops
Dude calls the cops and says I hit him
At this point I have to RUN out of the hotel get my Uber and go two hours back
He texts me and calls me probably times during this saying he has aids and then asking me to marry him
To this day the guy still tries to message me
Definitely never used tinder again
Emu war
Pronoun traps are absolutely ridiculous and immoral
You think someone ca code engineer teach stock shelves even because of their gender
And as far as the clothing thing I used to work in a grocery store that forbade women trans men included in that lump from having short hair otherwise they be put in the back
It was an official rule but it was there and it was devastating to trans men cis women nonbinary people alike
Even if it was for hiring mentally atypical people there the Americans with Disabilities Act for a reason
Not hiring someone because of their mental health is wrong
If they can do the job they can do the job regardless of if they trans cis mentally disabled mentally able anything
It actually gender dysphoria just so you know
It is classified in the DSM but for legal reasons
It not that having dysphoria is in and of itself a mental illness but it can be comorbid with other mental illnesses for the reason of lack of support
I do have the exact link at hand but could find it for you later if you want when supported by their families trans kids have a much better outlook on life much better mental and even physical health
As far as constant hormonal manipulation it highly highly I can not stress this enough highly regulated
You have to get damn near constant bloodwork checks to make sure your levels are within reason
People do steroids and it not a thing that puts people off and that less regulated more dangerous and for less valid reasons
As far as gender dysphoria do you think someone deserves to be treated poorly because of a mental health condition
I have depression do I deserve to be treated poorly
No
Well I also have diagnosed gender dysphoria
Does this mean I deserve to be treated poorly
It a comorbidity thing because of the way trans people are treated
The rates are exponentially lower in people with supportive families friends surroundings work environments etc
For the sex thing a lot of people do tell their partners for fear of trans panic
However if you still killed them you could claim it anyways but that besides the point
Do you think cis men have a moral obligation to tell their partner if they circumcised or not
Well that circumcision panic and it okay for me to kill them after finding out
You really should assume especially now
If it something that you have a problem with you should be the one to address it
Also if you have a problem with it I sure no trans person is going to want to sleep with you anyways
You can DM me if you want to talk more about this privately I always open to educating people on this because the stronger the community the stronger the individual

Women are told to be likeable pleasant and agreeable in general
The soothers the submissive essentially would ve been more overt back in the day but that s generally where the mindset comes from
So we feel we have no choice but to be surface level pleasant even with those who frustrate us because it s what s expected
It leads to fucked up female psychology where you re looked down upon if you don t keep the peace and you re considered a demon if you speak up about what someone is doing to annoy you
Some women are so unaccustomed to confrontation that they lash out and attack you for daring to criticise them openly instead of just keeping it to yourself
My friends and I are in our late and we have had many discussions about being more upfront and not doing the girl thing of gossiping or keeping it hidden if something bugs us
We said that as best friends we should be able to have tough conversations and sort out annoyances
But of course some of these girls later went ahead and just shut out a girl they became annoyed by and wouldn t tell anybody shit about what was bugging them about her
So she had no clue why they stopped talking to her it was so shitty
And the new girl thing for someone you dislike seems to be them on all socials but NEVER unfollow because that s aggressive
I unfollowed someone I fell out with bc we clearly weren t going to talk again and she got more mad about that than our actual fight
Yeah girl psychology gets exhausting
And we all know we do it to some extent
It s down to each individual to be brave and just risk the wrath if it I means being upfront and actually getting the problems out in the open and solved
I am sorry for assuming your wife s culture
Sorry to hear friend
Hope you get back into it
When people really make fun of kpop I don t hate it but I start to hate myself for liking it
God can you imagine one gripping you with its forelimbs and just taking a bite out of your abdomen first

People who talk about dental work in Mexico being great and so cheap are full of shit
Yes it cheap
It cheap because they do know what they doing
I went there twice for serious procedures

It should be illegal to go to Mexico for dental work

I know it probably not as extreme as some other ones here but that one scene in Boardwalk Empire where that dude was having sex with that redhead waitress and the guy with a gun runs in and fires and the other guy uses her as a body shield and leaves her to slowly die while him and the other guy shoot at each other
I mean shit his dick was probably still in her when she got hit
That probably not even the most extreme scene in the show but that one really affected me for some reason
Make Charlie and the chocolate factory animated but grandpa joe is just some old man awkwardly ambling around in a green screen
Try going without the internet for days heck even cut it down to hour a day from however many hours you put in
Now that s something we don t even truly require to survive imagine the same thing but with the stuff that allows us to keep living
Moderation or change from comfort is a very hard thing to do and something a lot of us can t do off a whim

I went over to this girls place
She told me her roomate was home but not to worry as he wouldnt bother us
So I came in everyone was friendl the roomate was on the couch watching TV we went to her room and hung out
One thing led to another and we were hooking up but she seemed to be unusually loud
Next thing I know I hear banging on the door and the roomate screaming you slut
Obviously I was shaken up considering this was just a random hookup
Turns out it was her ex she broke up with the night before fucking another guy out of spite
Never been so feared for my life
I feel like this would be even better if you kept Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald and cast Kermit as Hugh Glass
The scene in hereditary where the guy is asleep in his bed and his mom is on the ceiling above him
I could see her at first and i was really confused as to why the scene was so long and then i saw her and i freaked the fuck out

When I was in first year of my Bachelors degree at my university I had a good friend named let say M is a young dude for his time at university
He was only years old when he started his degree
So as time passed and as I came to be good friends with him I got to be invited to his birthday party
Namely his birthday to be exact
So there I was at his party and both M his friends from out of university and me all noticed the large amount of alcohol next to our table
Now all of us know exactly what happens when a group of young Australians mix with alcohol
It does end well at all
I got myself a little tipsy by having a few of tequila
Now I have never had alcohol before
Never

She always hitting big wins
Anywhere between and
As a result she always getting comps
Free rooms all the time
I known her about years and this sounded great
I wanted to know the trick
Well the trick is she has three mortgages on her house and borrows money from her sons all the time to pay bills with
Except she usually does pay the bills she goes to the casino with it
Elaborate
Have you tried being a guy on Tinder
He probably spent weeks waiting for a match that did ghost him immediately
You probably should assume that all guys are having that experience

The got through the first few seasons I think but the plot got extremely boring and kinda confusing
Not my state anymore but it a felony to steal an avocado in California
Dates back to the Depression when people stealing cash crops really threatened the livelihoods of a lot of farmers in the state
Stealing avocados got a really harsh punishment but as the law is written if I not mistaken even shoplifting one is still a felony though I doubt anyone has been actually charged
Besides an incestuous storyline

There a theory that when we were more nomadic as a species women would have the same kind of seasonal mating patterns most other mammals have
We basically followed the same patterns other animals followed when it came to mating periods and birth
As we recognized the benefits of agriculture our mating patterns shifted and as a result women periods became more irregular and potentially more frequent
Sex and procreation shifted from set patterns to something more spontaneous in response to being in closer proxity with each other for longer periods of time
This also has some causative relationship with our intelligence and size one of the many reasons why we are so physically helpless when we are infants is simply due to the fact that women can not carry babies for as long as we should because their heads grow too large to safely give birth to past a certain point
This is also why periods can cease or become infrequent while nursing to help ensure the survival of the newborn

You are wrong but I need someone who can survive long enough so that Teddy wroth might fade
That is a small list of candidates and I am sure that Goku would piss him off more
I been teaching myself to be nicer to everyone else even in my thoughts

I had severe head trauma and it turned me into a total alcoholic
There is a direct correlation between Post Concussion and Alcoholism it s all to do with disfunction in the endocrine system and the bodies hormonal levels especially in Males
If anyone is battling serve Post Concussion it can be reversed please don t give up
Most of Post Concussion is a result of chronic whiplash shutting off blood flow in the neck or displaced cranial plates shutting off the occipital muscles in the back of the head which again messes greatly with blood flow
It ends up shutting off the vertebral arteries supply to the brain a really big deal
If you re struggling look at ways to free up inflammation in the neck and shoulders with things like Prolotherapy Message and Functional Dry Needling also make sure all your cranial plates are in place with a registered Osteopath Therapist
It took me two years to rid myself of all the inflammation but now I feel like a new person
I was on suicide watch I was so bad and now I feel
CTE is a result of leaving problems like this for too long but if things are reversed Concussions aren t a death sentence
Women have more freedom and financial independence now
That s why
There are only stories
All I can think is I sorry for what you went through

Impractical Jokers like most half hour shows was only minutes long to make room for the commercial breaks
Several seasons in and IJ was by far the most popular show on TruTV
To encourage people to watch the show live they cut out a couple minutes of commercials and added Impractical Insider at the end of each episode
That consisted of Casey Jost interviewing the cast about events of that episode and showing an outtake or two
Judging by their social media the vast majority of people did realize it was extra footage and they thought TruTV was taking away minutes of Impractical Jokers to try to give Casey Jost a chance to be famous in front of the camera and most of that anger was directed at Casey
It did help that his on camera energy was low and almost depressing at times
It gets a little more complicated because he responded poorly on twitter to all the abuse he was getting which made people even more angry
He been involved with the show I think since the beginning and as far as I know he a pretty talented guy and the cast of the show seems fond of him

It entirely unfair to trick someone else to bond with someone intent on killing them self
That said there I ca help but wonder what it would been like to be close to someone

Wasn t there but a teacher told us that a junior year student made her cry once
She just had a miscarriage and was feeling pretty down not even a week had passed I think and a student made a joke about how she was looked off that day
She just suddenly started crying and the student felt so bad bc everyone was telling him off about how they made the teacher cry she had a great personality and always seemed very caring
The following week he came with a chocolate and apologised sincerely to her
The teacher was a little embarrassed about it I think bc she made him feel so guilty all week

Hair everywhere all the time
Yes I like this idea more
Laws are subjective
They change all the time
Especially international law
If they were subjective we would need courts lawyers and a police force
Morality is also subjective it just a philosophical construct it never absolute
What if the person who stole my bike needed it and it is now their only form of transport
I never used the bike anyway
But you are getting MY point
All your laws and morality are useless they do mean anything unless someone gives them power
Simply stating something is true because your rules say it is is childish
In the real world only actions and outcomes matter
Unless someone enforces your rules or morality it just you comforting yourself
Met this girl started texting
I told her my birth date and as she works for a lawyer s office was able to pull up my social security number address and did a background check on me

It was a cold winters day I hadn t masturbated in a week so I thought fuck it let s do an all day masturbation party to shorten the story I managed to jerk off a record times but by then end I had beaten my cock so hard I had grated the old layers of skin off it so it became a mast full of muscle my hand was severely blistered and scars remain to this day
To make it worse my sister came calling for sex again the next day since our parents weren t home and she almost bit of my monster cock during the first throatfuck I pulled out of her mouth and cum literally exploded out of her nose so to be sexy I started making out with her cum covered lips while licking her nostrils clean like I need the protein okay
This foreplay went on for another hours until I placed my withered now purple cock deep in her ass
I fucked her so hard that the cum that had found its way into her nasal cavity started flowing again
Man I wish I could relive that day
The ride photos are deleted after min and if anyone buys it they will pay more for high quality

Hit the apple on top of a woman head using a bow and arrow while both of you are falling from the sky you with a plane suit and she with a parachute

The Blues Brothers keep John Belushi
Obviously Animal is the drummer
Saving Private Ryan but keeping Tom Hanks
Just imagine the gore and all the Muppets being obliterated by Nazi Muppets
These stories remind me why I stopped internet dating

When me and him broke up he freaked out called me all sorts of names threatened to tell my mom about my nudes tried to turn our friends against me and threatened to take all of my gifts from him back
I didn t mind sending the gifts back but he said he didn t want them later so I was like whatever and I just blocked him on everything

Watermelon cider is for pregnant women and sissies
Yes I know quite a bit about black holes
They cool and scary to me
Lazy Bitch
I was and it was because they had put me into a gifted programme without any discussion with me
I has terrible executive functioning and already struggled to get my standard schoolwork done
The extra work was way too much for me so my Dad went in and asked them to take me out
Apparently this warranted my teacher pulling me aside and telling me that the Principal was calling me a lazy bitch
Yeah get back in the kitchen broad
Chocolate anise
My brother s birthday is the day before mine though is is four well almost four years younger than me
When he was four about to turn five and I was about to turn he was certain and proudly proclaiming that for one day he was going to be older than me
I spent hours explaining first patiently with props that I would line up for years and then angrily that he was wrong
I cared far too deeply about this and he was as certain as only a little kid can be so the day ended with both of us in tears screaming at each other
Gravity and keep Sandra Bullock

I m going to make a drone out of these parts
And you just made it because you re a fucking boss
That s so awesome LOL
Chef John from Foodwishes sounds drunk as fuck at speed and in my opinion it one of the funniest things on YouTube
https
I guess this is mainly for white people
Go to a place where you are the minority
Where you are the one being looked at and judged and
Where if people don t want to deal with you they simply won t and in fact it will be socially acceptable for them to ignore you
It s humbling and important for a well rounded human

Why do I want to see a muppet of the gimp
Waiting years to tell my family about my boyfriend
I had come out to them yet and was living miles away so it was easy to keep it a secret
Our relationship was new and intimate and we both liked that neither of our families were involved
I drunkenly confided in my cousin this summer and I never got the chance to tell the rest of my family as he outed me to my entire family before I made the decision to do it myself
If I had just told them from the beginning at least it would have been on my own terms and at least I would have that
I had planned out exactly how I wanted to do it and was building up the courage to do it but he took that away from me and he does even understand why I ca ever trust him again
The anger that I feel is more than I ever expected to and the man can not even admit he crossed a line
This was an incredibly important moment in my life stolen away in an instant
I was supposed to feel pride and peace but all I feel is regret and anger
The emotional toll of asking someone out at any point in the indefinite future
Trying really hard to scream and get someone to help but I ca even get to move one piece of me
Well I ai eating the tartar sauce that fer sure
Reservoir Dogs and only Harvey Keitel is real

The vast majority of them but if its the aspects that I think has the most danger to Society its being that they seem to adopt the other bad ism to suit their goals

Several times
One time many years ago I went to pick up from my usual dealer but this time I asked if I could bring my roommate who asked to come along
After the purchase dealer notices roommate who is sleepy from heroin and moving slow has a gun tucked into his waistband
I did know he had brought a gun
Dealer grabs gun leaves room before I even know what he grabbed and returns with a shotgun aimed my chest
Dealer is clearly very spun on meth during this whole ordeal
Says I gon na die for trying to rob him
Everything from then to when I left his house is kind of a blur
I remember saying Put the gun down
We already paid you
Why would we pay you if we were going to rob you
Put the gun down
He kept the roommate gun but let us leave with our drugs which I still find amusing today
Of course the roommate reported his gun as stolen because it was a legally owned firearm
The dealer could have easily taken back his drugs as well
Of the two things he could take from us the drugs were the choice we obviously could report stolen
And yet he sent us home with our drugs taking nothing but the gun
I hope he enjoyed the few days he had it
War of change
To be honest they will say now I have seen you masturbate yourself raw for the past two years do you think it time you went out and found yourself a girlfriend

I really think older generations didn t pass on common courtesy along with lots skills from dancing small talk handy man skills to their offsprings
And for this reason people are trying to discover what s good and what s bad
The problem with experimenting is the baggage that people don t realize it brings
And for this reason people don t appreciate the quality on people for both genders

I matched with a girl who went to my college and she had a friend who stayed in my dorm building
She invited me over one night when she was at her friend s place and told me that there was only one other guy there for her friend and that she was lonely
When I get to her friend s dorm there are black dudes chilling there
I ignore the fact that she lied about the ratio and agree to play Cards Against Humanity with them
After a while of playing I find out the friend s guy is a marine and suddenly he asks the girl that invited me over if she would hook up with his friend and she agrees
I remembering that the other guy was here first get up to leave
As I am leaving the girl tells me to stay and essentially have a threesome with her and the other random black guy
I refuse and begin to leave
After I leave and shut the door behind me I hear the marine along with the girl and her friend begin to berate me for leaving and not having the threesome
I then walk back inside as I have never been one to take anyone s shit for no reason
I ask him what was wrong with him and why he was acting this way
He says Because I felt like I had to
I then say to him Well I feel like I have to say Fuck you
What do you think about that After about another minute of silence I told him that I was going to leave but was more than willing to continue the altercation if he wanted to
He says nothing and after some more awkward silence I leave and I don t hear him on the way out this time
The girl who initially invited me sent me a snapchat after I left but I blocked her before I opened it
I still wonder what she said to this day and how she could possibly think that I would say yes to fucking her with some random dude
Came here to say this

Water park section is clothing optional
I feel incredibly angry because my good friend Summer and her partner Lime moved out of an apartment with Summer crazy ex but right up to the very last day Crazyex could not take responsibility for her actions and chose to yell and swear at Summer for no other reason than to try and save her own skin
I try to give a basic rundown without omitting too much info
Crazyex is the worst kind of person
She a compulsive liar she controlling she bought a different internet service than what Summer wanted just so she could have total control over the internet and proceeded to overcharge their parts she a thief and she emotionally abusive
Summer and Crazyex moved into the apartment after dating long distance for a couple years and within a couple months Crazyex broke up with Summer KICKED HER out of their bedroom but kept Summer king bed and wardrobe
Then she proceeded to bring guys over ALL THE TIME at ALL hours of the night
She rarely stays at the apartment for more than a couple of days and this continued even after my and I got involved
Back near the end of January this year Summer and Lime approached Crazyex to suggest maybe she be happier finding another place to live because they know she does like living there
But all this accomplished was pissing off Crazyex to the point she started moving her stuff out with the help of her crazy dad he kept calling my friends deadbeats and going off about serving three years in the military just for deadbeats to do this and others
In this process she stole Summers side table which she was using to hold her record player
Summer has sent two emails and also asked her IN PERSON to return it but to this day she still has not and has only provided excuse after lie to avoid having to do so and we all know she took the table because she wanted it and she thought that Summer would have the backbone to ask for it back
But I digress
So a couple of weeks go by and its a couple of days after and my friends decide to try and talk to her about a release form they have from the apartment office
This paper will allow one or more people to be taken off the lease and let go of all responsibilities if all parties agree
However Crazyex states firmly SHE is going anywhere
Then my friends tell her to let them leave then because they do want to be there anymore
Crazyex says she wo sign the form until she has people to replace them and asks for time to do that and she asked to be given until the end of March so they agreed
Now my and I started staying at Summer apartment since January because they wanted advice on how to handle this situation
We tried our best to give them advice that would turn things into a shit show but once I saw just what kind of person Crazyex is I recorded any and all interactions we had with her
I have recordings of her stealing my friends property I have her saying' I did take it
My dad did because he thought it was mine
I have her saying I cant bring the table back my dads not home I cant get into the house the doors blocked I have her asking for the end of March
So the end of March comes and my friends have not heard a SINGLE word from Crazyex
She has made any sign that she found people to replace them nor has she said that she having trouble finding others
But they held up their end of the bargain and waited until April so they decide to start moving out into my and my place like we planned a long time ago
It took about three days because Summer got sick but on the last day the really hit the fan
I walked back into their apartment from taking stuff to the car to Summer being SCREAMED and SWORN at by Crazyex
She was going off at her about how she being laid off she has found people yet and maybe she will after this pandemic blows over and tried to make Summer feel guilty about how she gets to work with her parents and Crazyex does have that privilege
She then ORDERED Summer to go and pay for April rent even though the leasing office is closed due to the virus and they do have an online account set up to pay the rent
Summer is off on sick leave Lime is on benefits I been laid off due to the virus and my ca find work But Crazyex is the only one having a crappy life I guess
I managed to record the tail end of the yelling but after we collected enough for the day we left and chilled at our place
I asked what the hell that was about and it all started because Summer asked how Crazyex was doing with finding people
tldr Crazyex asked for more time to look for people to replace my friends on the lease but failed to do so by the time her time was up and got mad at my friends for leaving after holding up their end of the agreement
I pissed at Crazyex because I KNEW she would try to pull something or try to weasel her way out of doing her part in all this

I had a friend going through a traumatic time divorce from abusive husband with two toddlers
she d been pretty well separated from her support structure by her abuser aside from me and my other friend so when she needed help we were the only ones who could physically assist her
Helped her with her kids got her to the police station to file for restraining order helped her move helped gather her stuff when she was evicted helped her move again over several months my husband and I repeatedly helped her when she and I don t regret that so much as when things were stabilizing for her the only time I ever heard from her was when it was an emergency
She didn t call to chat or ask to meet for lunch
When I contacted her to talk it was all about her I tried to not hold it against her things were pretty bad for a but the friend aspect wore away and all that was left was her personal emergency squad
Things got better but I just couldn t talk to her anymore
I m glad she s safe and happy but the friendship was collateral damage from that hard time in her life

Setup of distillation columns
We had to separate propane propene and propadiene
Propane and propene are closer in vapor pressure than either are to propadiene It is harder to separate propane and propene from each other than it is to separate either from propadiene
My logic was to have our first column separate out the propadiene then have the second column separate the propane and propene from each other
In this scenario the second column could be fine tuned for this specific separation and would have to deal with massive flows
We also have a high yield of propadiene
My friend logic was to have the first column separate propene out then have the second column separate the propane from the propadiene
In this scenario the propene stream is contaminated with propadiene only with trace amount of propane
The second column can do a very easy separation of propane and propadiene
We argued for like minutes
The professor was like omg nobody cares their vapor pressures are that far apart just run it in Aspen That being said was
My scenario is cheaper because our second column can be skinnier albeit a tiny bit taller and I also got acceptable purities in my streams
My friend got amazing purities but his columns were enormous and he required like the energy mine did

I did this to my brother
I secretly turned on the Bluetooth speaker connected it to my phone and hid it behind my pillow of my top bunk bed
Then I casually walked downstairs and just waited for someone to go upstairs to our bedroom
But then I got bored and impatient because it took a long time for someone to go to the bedroom
But I kept my usual attitude and asked my lil bro to get my Harry Potter book
Then while he was going upstairs to fetch my book I readied the Monsters Theme song meme on my phone
I hastily played the music when he got into the bedroom
His reaction was what I was expecting
I thought if he heard the music he know and would just laugh but it was the complete opposite
I heard thuds and panicked footsteps on our bedroom floor
Then my brother dashed downstairs tripping on the second landing really scared but he was also laughing
He got my book though
He still does know who played the music that he was scared
My lil sis went to the bedroom followed by our lil bro
I played the music again and they raced downstairs scared for their lives
They were laughing and confused all the same
But I was different
I was dying out of laughter
I confessed then that I pranked them
They were not mad they just understood as I always pranks but they were also surprised

I started dating this girl who I had liked since grade and when she asked me I was the happiest man on earth
Did last too long only weeks as she constantly talked about how our wedding is going to be and how many kids we are going to have and like basically everything related to marriage
I was so freaked out as I have never even thought about marriage and this girl was already talking about kids
I broke up and then was stalked by her for a couple of months until she got over
We went out only times

Even when I lucid dream people do believe me
It took place in my high school
This dream was easily ten years ago and I have been out of high school for years now
It was incredibly vivid
I suddenly realized while in school that I was dreaming
I thought it was amazing sadly I tried to convince everyone in the dream that they were in my dream the entire time
I magically had roller skates on going down the hallway I made a rainbow appear I danced like Fred Astaire up and down the steps
In a fit of desperation I had everyone look out the window a car blow up and then reversed it back together
Not a soul believed me nor were they impressed
So while I loved doing all the magical stunts and can remember it all quite clearly it a bittersweet memory
I would love a psychiatrist or psychologist to weigh in on this I am assuming something something imposter syndrome
FYI I am neither coordinated nor athletic which is why the roller skating and professional dancing were meant to prove the dream state

Huevos Rancheros
This is a super long comment and I apologize greatly
This happened six years ago and afterwards I deleted Tinder and never looked back
This guy and I messaged for about a week before meeting up
I ll call him Adam for sake of the story
Not his real name
We went for coffee which went fine
No real spark on my end but he seemed like a nice guy asked me questions about myself and seemed to actually pay attention to what I was saying
Decent conversation but still awkward like most first dates are especially when you ve never met before
I felt like maybe a second date would give me a better read so I didn t go with my gut and end things after date like I should have
As we were leaving he tried to kiss me but I very awkwardly dodged it and told him I wasn t ready for that yet
I ve kissed on first dates I mean fuck I ve fucked on first dates before on my on volition but I just wasn t feeling anything there physically to want to kiss him
Should ve been a red flag for me
Adam seemed fine with it so we hugged and said goodbye
The next day I went to the beach with some friends to stay for a few days
Being at the time social media was a big deal right
So of course I posted on snapchat and instagram that we were at the beach and duh not thinking how I think now tagged the beach we were at with the geolocation
I should mention that Adam lived an hour North of me
he drove an HOUR to get coffee with me
To get to the beach from my place was about an hour and a half away driving West
Maybe three hours went by and my friends and I were having a blast at the gathering wood for a bonfire drinking a bit
We had a rental nearby and a designated driver I m responsible
I get a text from Adam you re at Name I m at too
s weird I thought does Adam know i m at the beach
I start looking around paranoid and creeped out
And then I see a figure in the distance
Walking down the beach in our direction
Waving at

It can t be Adam
How would he even know how to find me here
This beach is massive
I ll admit I ignored his wave and pretended not to see him
Didn t want to assume he showed up knowing I was there driving what would have taken him hours to get there
My friends noticed me acting weird and I told them the situation
Adam waltzed right up to us and forced me into a hug
My friends began introducing themselves and the good ones started trying to save me by saying well we were all just about to head out
Great meeting you though One of my guy friends who loves to mess with me then offered Adam a beer
Adam answered with well I d hate to impose I saw and wanted to stop and say hi
Was just here looking for rocks and i m staying for the Of course he ended up imposing
If something like that happened today I d have zero issue calling someone out and telling them Thanks for stopping by pal
Sayonara but I was such a people pleaser back then and also a lil bitch
We all hung out at the bonfire and drank a bit more
At the end of the night we go to leave and Adam tries inviting himself back to our rental
Lol nope
We offered to drop him wherever he was staying because we didn t have any more room at the a total lie
This dude had the audacity to suggest oh it s fine guys I ll just sleep in s bed with her but luckily one of my friends stepped in and said we were already all double bunking we weren t
We dropped him off at a nearby hotel he claimed to be staying where he tried to kiss me and I completely dodged it again this time by quickly jumping back into the car and immediately shutting my door
We watched him walk into the hotel but our sober driver had a sneaking suspicion that Adam didn t have a room at all
We pulled around and parked where he couldn t see us
A few minutes later Adam walked out of the hotel and we watched as a cab picked him up
You d think this is where Adam s story ends it isn t
About a week later I was at a friends house a few blocks away from my place
It was and I had planned to stay the night there with her
Then I got a text
you home
in the absolute FUCK is Adam asking me if i m home
I tell my friend she was also at the beach for the Adam incident and she says to ignore him not to respond
I took her advice didn t text him back
A few minutes later my phone started ringing
I ignored it
It rang again
He texted me again
would really like to apologize for what happened at the beach
I don t respond
My phone rings again at this point I m frustrated I m annoyed so i answered
s at my apartment
I couldn t figure out how he knew where I lived
He d never been to my apartment nor did I tell him my address
My friend bullied me into going with her to my apartment
She wanted me to confront him about his behavior
At first I tell her no repeatedly
But you know how things can get especially when you have friends gassing you up
We head to my apartment
I m nervous as hell
guy could murder us
He could be a fucking psychopath stalker and m u r d e r us
I type the buttons into my phone s keypad I don t hit the call button but you know in case
Adam s sitting on the hood of his car when we arrive
We approach him as he stands a bouquet of a dozen red roses in hand
I asked him how he knew where I lived but he said that I told him
I never told him I knew that for an absolute fact
I told him this and he kept repeating that you told me when we went for coffee remember I m a pretty easygoing gal I go with the flow I m a happy but then I was pissed
There was absolutely no way I told him where I lived
Even then I knew better than to tell somebody that on a first date
At that point I was yelling
Why are you here
He went to hand me the roses and said I just wanted to apologize for how I acted at the beach
You stopped talking to me afterwards and I figured I did something to cause that
And I just wanted to see I backed away from him not accepting the roses
I told him that he made me uncomfortable that it was wildly inappropriate to drive to my apartment at barely knowing me without an invitation and that I didn t want to see him His response
Well what then I m just supposed to drive the hour back home
I started laughing because I was so frustrated and angry
I remember screaming back at him Oh I m sorry did you think I was EVER going to let you sleep here He called me a cunt and got back into his car peeled out of my complex s parking lot
I never had to deal with him again
I know all of this was my fault by not going with my gut and ending things after the first date
I was too nice and wasn t straightforward about not being into him
By no means did I lead him on or make it seem like I was I didn t reach out to him
When he was with us at the beach I avoided him like the plague and barely spoke to him at all
When I did I didn t there were a few do you want a drink from him but at most I said no thank At the same time I also didn t tell him I don t see this going anywhere I m not even remotely interested in you and I think not only do some people need that to get the hint but I also think it s the decent thing to tell people straight up that you aren t interested
I definitely learned my lesson with this guy
I feel like I dodged a huge bullet as his behavior was not normal creepy and weeeeeeeeeird as fuck
We discovered that my social media snapchat instagram had location sharing on
Anytime I posted on snapchat my friends could see where I was on a map
On instagram I d always tag my home as the same place
We think that must be how he figured out where I live
As far as the specific apartment complex my friends theorize that he must have been looking in the area for me and saw my very identifiable only old ass volvo wagon in my area covered in and Led Zeppelin stickers
I d love to believe it all was just a coincidence and that Adam was just a really sweet guy and that I was a rude bitch and that he was at the beach that day doing his own thing but unfortunately I really don t think that s the case
conclusion tinder can be fun but it can also be scary and sometimes depressing
Kindly tell people you go on dates with immediately you realize you aren t interested in them
Some people don t get hints and honestly telling them outright is just the better thing to do that way nobody wastes their time
Don t share your home location on social media because you never know who may be dying to get that information
TL DR went on okay date with nice guy
went to beach with friends guy stalked my location and drove hours to coincidentally show up at same beach
Showed up at my apartment later

Trust me your not missing out on too much
Would I call somebody who thinks being gay is a choice ignorant
Totally
Homosexuality is found in nature throughout most species not to mention the point of the post which is why would you choose this given a lot of the societal opposition
You can choose to not like it or think it s wrong or whatever although that s just as dumb but to say it s a choice is to ignore basic science
Or hear me out everyone is a muppet except the baby

Divorce is not as much of a stigma or as scandalous as it was in the past
Until the in the US divorce was seen as a bad thing
Divorced women used to be seen as used goods
No fault divorces became common in the
Before then both husband and wife usually hired lawyers to prove the other party was at fault then they could negotiate a divorce settlement

People are not as committed to solving relationship problems as they were in the past
It a lot easier to leave and start over than to try to repair relationships and for many people that would involve admitting their faults and working toward changing themselves
Guns don t work underwater which means police can t stop me
Essentially the same equivalent of yoga pants except not see through
Like butts look better in baseball uniform pants imho

Lmfaoo what

I gave up about years ago
Best decision I ever made
I like being responsible only for myself and not having to worry about anyone else drama
I do miss the sex either
I realise I was just having it to keep the guy interested
I consider myself asexual now
It takes the pressure off my life and I really happy
I have friends I like family who love me a job that easy and forgettable when Friday afternoon comes around
And I have way more time for crafting and art and other creative endeavours that I did have when I was dating
I highly recommend singlehood to anyone who has struggled to find love but not succeeded
You need to ask yourself why you still pursuing it
A lot of the time you probably find it because you want someone else to fill the void in your life and self esteem
But once you give all that love and attention to yourself you might find you do need from anyone else
But if you do still want someone else you find that because you genuinely happy with life and yourself that you attract someone wonderful without any effort

That i didnt want to go
I went shortly after graduating highschool
i spent two years taking classes hating it
eventually stopped going and now i have student loans i can barely afford
Yeah had i finished maybe i couldve gotten a job to pay them back
but i could be in the same spot just without debt had i not gone
I went because i was told i had to to be happy and it was the thing to do
Modern Warfare the original one
It was a pioneer in FPS games where it made realistic shooters set in the modern era accessible to more people and I honestly think its presentation themes writing and use of certain gameplay mechanics notably the mission make it one of the best pieces of media in my opinion
World at War is hella fun too
Not tinder but my first online dating experience ever was a girl I met from OKC about years ago
She was and I was so it seemed like a pretty solid deal
We talked for a couple days over text and she invited me over to watch movies
I decided to agree and drove like minutes to her apartment
When I got there everything seemed cool and she took me back to her room after I said hi to her roommate
Then when she opened the door the entire room was COVERED in Justin Bieber One Direction and tons of other awful boyband memorabilia
Like there was a thing in the room that did have some kind of poster figurine or sticker of the stuff
I decided to just have a laugh about it and we started watching The Notebook of all things
Things went good for about half an hour and she was hinting that she was in the mood and I figured a hookup would be fun
Then I hear a huge slam from the living room and her roommate starts beating on the door like there no tomorrow angrily screaming for her to open up
She got off the bed and did so only to have her roommate start screaming at her about stealing her hot wings from the fridge
Only to have her say they were old anyways and she figured she did want them
I tried to calm them down but her roommate told me to fuck off and mind my own business
So then she told her to calm the fuck down and quit being a bitch
Then her roommate started pushing her and she started pushing back until it erupted into a full on punching slapping hairpulling screeching grapplefest
At that point I decided to grab my phone and stuff and said I was gon na go
They kinda stopped for a second and the girl I came to see said I should just stay and my exact words were Nah fuck that
As I let myself out I heard the yelling start up again and then some banging around from what I assumed was the fight starting up again
Got in my car and headed home and went to sleep
Then I got a text from her the next day apologizing and saying that just how they are
Did respond at all
Deleted OKC and did use any dating apps for like a year
Told my friends a couple days later after it happened and thanks to how hard they laughed at what happened it just became a funny memory pretty quick
Hot wings are a helluva drug

Everyone was a raging asshole
There was no one to cheer for
Once Walt has the opportunity to not do crime and have his old partner pay for his treatment and he refuses because enjoys being a drug he s not even a Kingpin or anything by then literally just cooking meth I was out
Jimmy is trying to be better and his backslides make good TV
Other people like Kim have solid qualities
Even Chuck was really into the case helping the old people for a while
Even Nacho is doing all the shit he s doing to help his dad
There s so much more moral grey in BCS and that makes is so much more enjoyable
I love it

Something with Keanu
Well unless you working at a professional job you probably do have health insurance so going to see the doctor for a yearly physical becomes a waste of money

That s one of the only reasons i believe in the concept of ghosts
Since i ve never had an ghostly encounter i look at this logically Uncle who s a serious construction worker all about physical work that can t watch horror movies
Aunt who s a party planner just planner for events in general that loves drinking
Older cousin who has a history of physical and mental illness that can t be changed she thinks what she thinks
Aunt who s all about control very and wants nothing to do with stuff that makes her lose her status as a leader
Uncle who s a obvious sociopath that hates paranormal stuff who lost his shit after seeing it

Ruining the relationship between my cousins and the cabin who re the ones who s gon na get to use it however they like when our parents are
This is genuine proof sadly even though i don t want to believe in it since it scares the shit out of me
I ve never seen them agree on anything except this one thing
My dad was the snitch and grandma confirmed it since it s weird they never went back it was a family tradition
I live in Norway we don t believe in paranormal concepts
It s a wild world

Meditate and breathe deeply
Find something to appreciate each day
Rogers' advice was to look at at the helpers in scary situations
That is love and care in action
That is bravery and service and duty
We have a lot to be thankful for

it would be boring to travel the world if everyone did everything the same

Intermission
Kinda late on this but I still share
Also grindr not tinder but same shit it was for a date not a hookup Messaged a guy who I thought was cute
He so I a couple years older but that fine
Turned out he and I had a lot of the same interests like hardcore music and MMA
Honestly hard to find that with gay guys
Also turned out he was British which I was very into
That accent probably a fetish of mine idk
So we talked for a couple days and make plans to go to a bar
Literally ends up being one of the best dates I ever been on
Spent hours at the bar and like hours hanging out at my house
He was everything I hoped he would be
But as we kept drinking he started bringing up more about himself and that he apparently a mild celebrity from a powerful British family
I did care whether he was or not but I was interested in this especially since he said he worked with a bunch of bands I liked
But he would tell me more about who he actually was and said the name he gave me was just a nickname since he wanted someone to like him for who he was before anything else
Of course I try to figure this out as soon as he leaves
And I did
Found it from another nickname I remember tattooed on his arm
He nowhere close to being a celebrity
He not
He not British the accent was fake
And a week before we met he just got out of jail for child molestation
Found all this in a news article about him saying he a con artist who fakes a British accent and that he might have more victims
So yeah that kinda fucked with my head for a little bit
Showed them how knifes work so the person can live but have organs and bone marrow sold better when they scream so you can monitor that you are actually causing harm

Nihilism
Because it all fucking pointless
As a fairly young dude who also does have any teeth he can control the spitting most of the time
You just have to swallow a bit more frequently because you do have your teeth to help keep more in your mouth is all
Also there is a solid bone that your teeth are attached to and it does feel a whole lot different than making out with someone who does have teeth according to my SO
Threatening to gum the shit out of people is fun though
I had all of my teeth taken out at and am currently so it has been a fun journey and also dentures are expensive as shit and I can completely believe he could afford them
To stay at home during this pandemic
Being able to stay at my girlfriend house
Every day she asks me every day it s like an hour after we have a snack

Before my pregnancy I d wake up early to walk the dogs when it was his turn to walk the dogs so he could sleep in

He runs to the bathroom I m in to hold my hair back when I m puking even if it happens ten times a day and he was busy doing something else

They were arguing whether it was applicable to still called it Hidden Valley ranch when we clearly know where they valley it was hidden in
Another friend said that the valley was called HIDDEN valley just as a cool name
After what was probably a good half hour of them going back and forth I was getting sick of it
I semi yelled Guys guys
You can take the ranch out of the hidden valley but you ca take the hidden valley out of the ranch
They both look at me like they both just had the most profound life changing experience

Message to my friend immediately after waking up I just had this weird ass dream that was like super lucid that it felt like another life bruh
But shit slowly started getting wacky like the matrix and gave me signs that something wasn t right so I tried to wake up which felt like I was trying to traverse dimensions btw shit was cool and it hurt my head and I popped up in my bed but I couldn t move and I was about to start trying when before I knew it I went back into the realm that I left with my boss getting on to me about being gone from where I was supposed to be felt like I zoned out for like an hour standing in one spot I didn t remember anything and so I went to where I was supposed to be I heard some co worker talking with somebody and for some god damn reason she used in somebody s name which got me thinking that something wasn t right again so I broke dimensions again and I was in my room again and I was slowly rolling over but it slowly got harder and harder couldn t feel my limbs face numb and when I got of the way on my back I saw this tall black shadow and my head felt like cotton and I could hear my blood flowing through me and put my foot out to block it or something and it made my right foot go numb instantly and then I woke up for real
I was sleeping on my left side btw there s no way my right foot would ve gotten its circulation cut off
I still feel it shits weird
Feel like I got assaulted by a ghost And the weirdest thing is a lot of my back problems went away after that night

I took a Telecommunications technology course in college in the early that was taught by a former AT T executive
Throughout the course he continually threw in his OPINION that breaking up AT T was the stupidest thing the government could do
I did know much about it at the time government broke it up in I think but in retrospect AT T was inhibiting all manner of technological innovation and once they were broken up new telecommunications products and services went nuts leading up to paging cell phones and the internet
The guy was completely on the wrong side of history

I do recommend a mortgage with mortgage insurance
After paying it for a few years I could understand why my payment did seem to be paying down the balance
Turns out my mortgage insurance was a month
This meant very little of my payment was going to my balance
That money did go to my balance and if I would have kept paying it would have been extra for a house
The total with interest was
I refinanced with another bank with no mortgage insurance and this made a huge difference
Now more payment goes to the balance
That insurance is a fee for being under income
It does go to you or your payments

Happy cake day
This happened in my freshmen year of high school
I was changing in the locker room when all of a sudden this mean girl came up to me
Long story short she kept insulting me and when I tried to push her away to get to class she shoved me against the locker
Now I m really small so I could easily fit into one of the huge lockers
Before I could do anything she spun me around and gave me a wedgie the one day I decided to wear a thong hurt like hell
Then she picked me up by my panties and put me on a hook in the locker and I was really short so I couldn t even reach the ground
To make things worse she ripped my shorts off and threw them across the room
Then she closed the door and locked it so I was just hanging
No one besides us were in the locker room so no one saw this
She laughed and left me there all gym class
minutes of just hanging by my thong worst pain I ve ever felt

Mambo blasting in an Uber
I m about to turn and just paid off my student loans
I worked super hard and lived cheap in school to pay for a lot of things out of pocket and have done the same since graduation in order to pay down the loans I did have to take out as fast as possible
I told some close friends and got a mix of responses ranging from just congrats to must be nice and brag about I don t mean to brag or anything I was just happy and felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders like I can finally start living life more fully
I understand it could be hard to hear a friend is debt free while you still have loans to pay off I guess I just hoped they d be happy for me since I would be happy and excited for them in the same situation

Oh looks like Fred was right I send someone down here to fix it
He leaves
Another guy comes three hours later and puts a pilon in front of it
Leaves
Three hours later another guy comes and throws salt around it
Leaves
My friend went home at that point of time because his shift was done got replaced by another cop

but no one ever knows her actual name for some reason
Someone once even asked me Are you Brave
although admittedly that person happens to be somewhat of a local cryptid story for another time so I not entirely sure she was about to invite me to join her on a magical quest
And Old women will constantly tell me I know you probably hate your hair but do ever dye it because you miss it once you old and gray

A fence around my pool
I have two young children one who is only two
We bought our house with a pool in the back yard
I didn t want a pool but the situation in our market really limited our options if we insisted on buying a house without a pool
It was cheaper to buy this house with a pool than some of the other houses without them
I am trying to drill into my kids heads that they can NOT go into the back yard without an adult
But they are only and and I am not sure how effective that is
They both know how to open the patio door to the back yard
I like my actual house but that death trap in my back yard makes me afraid for them every day

We saw and felt some fucked up stuff at enchanted forest in Oregon
I do work there but I been there after it closed and it was almost unbearable
I grew up in Santa Cruz so always at the beach boardwalk from lost boys and us and that not creepy at all compared to enchanted forest but it sure was in that movie us
I had a sick feeling in a really old roller rink we snuck into at thousand oaks park near portland
It was a very creepy vibe even though it was midday and sunny outside

Excuse me but what in the sweet potato fuck
To a part of a loving and supportive family
I met her boyfriend
I was about at the time and she was which was a little younger than I would have liked but she was funny and cute and I figured I give it a try
I picked her up and the first red flag was she immediately asked if she could smoke her cigs in my car to which I gave a resounding no
We drove downtown and parked and I figured I take her to this local hipster restaurant
She looked a little confused and replied no her boyfriend was there and she never been inside because they do serve anyone under
I was completely taken aback and immediately chalked this date up to a loss and told her guaranteed they served people under my friends and I all went all the time
This royally pissed her off and we headed over there to confront her boyfriend and I figured I just come along to see what happened
We get to the restaurant and she points us to a table with a portly year old man in a bowler hat a skinny crying guy with long hair and a regular looking dude in a polo
The year old man with the bowler beckons me over separately for a chat and he orders her some drinks to mollify her
He tells me he recently divorced and he met her at a local hot topic where he a manager
Bowler hat gives me a gross speech about how the young girls there love guys in power and he can have as many of them as he wants anytime
He then asks me what I planning on doing with her tonight and I assure him I have absolutely zero interest
He claps me on the shoulder tells me he believes me but tells me to be cool because their drug dealer is here and his friend was just murdered so they trying to show him a good time
Apparently the drug dealer buddy was found at the bottom of a lake in his car filled with bullets
We go back to the table and I make awkward small talk with the group there and they invite me to come play pool since otherwise they have uneven teams
Bowler hat keeps giving the girl drinks and she starts to get sloppy drunk hitting on me and her boyfriend at the same time
I politely keep denying her advances and Bowler hat keeps giving me thumbs up
At about we all ready to go home and we realize the drug dealer who been quietly sobbing and drinking all night is gone
Downtown is a swampy area and there a few lakes and ponds nearby so everyone is worried that he has tried to drown himself or fed himself to the alligators
We start a search party and ofcourse the girl pairs with me and we do a desperate but careful search around the various bodies of water nearby to no avail
We all regroup I wave goodbye to everyone and try to get back in my car and the girl chases after me and yells to her boyfriend that not to worry I was gon na take her home
She then whispers that she has some coke we can both do and that it really is as bad as everyone says
I tell her I pretty tired so no thanks send her back to her boyfriend and I drive home to my house and go to bed
She called me every day for a few weeks asking for rides for cigarettes or groceries and eventually after denying her enough she got the hint
Yah no
They re very cynical and hate women

Befriended them
Made sure I was showing face with simple hellos before or a bye after class
Tried to participate in class even if only the gimmes
If you think they are tough most people probably do too
And with that those teachers probably do get much attention from their students
So if you can spare a little here and there it takes you a long way
At least it did for me
I was a football player in college and was the best student
One thing I picked up quick was the teachers you actually showed some interest in were the first ones that be willing to work with you when things got tough
One time when I was about I was getting into a tub with hot bath water and all of a sudden my thigh started bleeding no cut all that was left was like a lightning bolt shaped vein with a mole in front of it haha
I think it s gone away but I haven t looked or thought about it in a long time

I pronounce the word gerbil as
My mother got PISSED and told me it s pronounced
She was legitimately enraged I still can t figure it out
She yelled for at least an hour about how stupid I was and how there s no WAY I was so stupid that I didn t know how to pronounce gerbil and I was clearly messing with her which makes me an awful child
Throughout the day I had family members coming up to me awkwardly like oh man you can t pronounce gerbil
Everyone KNOWS it s I know as a fact my mother set them on me and they came after me to get on her good side
Over the pronunciation of gerbil
To this day five years later if I suggest something or try to correct something I m met with yeah but you couldn t pronounce gerbil so who gives a shit what you God I can t wait to move out
Fun fact we were at a pet store a few years after this and I was looking at the small animals
They happened to have a gerbil and one of the employees came over and asked do you want to pet the gerbil
She s really sweet Mom went red in the face and haughtily replied No we wouldn t like to pet the GURBULL thank you
We don t need any more pets especially not a That poor employee looked so tired
Mom accused me of setting her up
Good times
When I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety
Up till then I just thought everyone had suicidal thoughts sometimes and that they just got through it all on their own and that I had to too
But getting diagnosed opened my saw a world that existed beyond my pointless lonely struggling and a safe environment in which to chase that world
It been a hard road but I married now to the guy I was dating when I was diagnosed during college and life is pretty good all things considered
I different but now I know that it also ADD and my treatment helps me if I stick with it
Dreamt I was in the hospital
I decided to see what would happen if I died
So I chose to stop my heart
I heard the heart monitor flat line
Then all was changed to a wooden dock and a boat at the end
Think River Stix mixed with Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince where Dumbledore and Harry go for the Horcrux in the cave
There was an old man at the end of the dock
He was there to ferry me to the next life
I hopped on
I was half way across when my alarm went off for work unfortunately
Good to know if I die in a dream I still live in the real world
Then again I chose to die
Maybe that makes a difference
Never before have I related more to a robot lmao
Pulp fiction
keep Samuel L Jackson need I say more
Shit
There would have to be a LOT more golf courses
Yes I like to learn new skills sometimes I need to slow it down so i dont have to keep going back
John Wick keep Keanu Reeves
Just cotton fluff and fabric flying everywhere
It is also my understanding China is very secretive
Keeping stuff on a' ca be that hard
The number of people who would to know means that they would not be able to keep it quiet
Especially considering the damage that has been done to their own country
China is not quite as secretive as it was in the days of the Tienanmen square protests
People would talk
losing a couple thousand people is a small price to pay to release the virus
What about the price of the lockdown
In that case sending the doctors looks like a pretty pointless move by China apart from the political aspect
More manpower as well as the political aspect
This virus evolves very quickly and it has been spreading all over the world for quite some time now I would be so sure it the same virus as the one that started it
It is still the same virus https
The first doctors to discover and worry about what had happened in China were apparently silenced
China is an extremely oppressive country the exact same thing happened with the SARS outbreak
Also last week my country received about million face masks from China
Yesterday it was discovered these masks are of quality
I mean they from china
I sorry for the conspiracy theory but if this does make anyone else suspicious I wonder what needs to happen before people suspect some kind of foul play
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
If China wanted to deal a serious blow to the economies of their perceived enemies why would they do it in a way that they could get caught trying to kill hundreds of thousands of civilians from other countries which I think would basically be a declaration of war
Why would they release it in their own country instead of releasing it a different country and taking immediate action closing their border
Again I hope I wrong about all this
Good news you probably are

Freak household accident
This was before I ever had any first aid classes so I did know to flush them out
I was home alone and even after my parents got home an hour later I did tell them for a while because I knew they could really afford a trip to the emergency room
Finally I just could take the pain any longer and I told my parents what happened
The ER doctor said that it was too late to prevent any damage as my natural tears would have flushed all the chemicals out but he applied some topical killer cream to my eyes and wrapped them with bandages
I had to keep the bandages covering my eyes for a full days

Nah my character is pretty confidnet their alone but if someone uses it to say kill someone in broad daylight as a DM i always tell them in this world there are consequences and show them how that will go down
idk if this counts as a horror story lmao
but i had just broken up with my college boyfriend of a year and some change and i started going on tinder dates to try and fill the void
normal sad girl shit
i meet this dude who has only memes on his profile and being a meme connoisseur myself i match with him and we start talking
he seems really cool just like me he also fresh out of a relationship and i think at the very least we could have a nice night out together
i found out he lives hella far away and does drive but he says it worth the bus ride out to where i am and we set a date for friday night
cool
im waiting outside for him when i notice a dude standing on the opposite corner of the street
at first it does register in my mind that it might be the guy i was waiting for
he like twice my height fedora clad neckbeard bro with a captain america which is necessarily my type but i had asked to see a picture of him before agreeing to meet so i called out his name and he turned to look at me and waved
he crosses the street we go upstairs to my dorm to drop off his stuff i lived in a single at the time and then we came back downstairs to go out and get food
as soon as we sit down at the boba place and snacks he starts telling me about his ex
honestly
i was in a bad place too so i ALSO start talking about my ex and we start to bond over a general hatred for our previous partners he was cheated on by his ex i was gaslit by mine and i realized i was really starting to like him
things were going pretty good so we went back to my place and listened to music smoked a few bowls and played smash bros on the switch he brought
i had never played smash so he taught me how it worked and i quickly went from accidentally falling off the edge to whooping his sorry ass
i was high and enjoying myself so i thought it was funny but i started to notice him getting more and more frustrated with the fact i was winning when less than an hour ago i did even know how to hold the
he insisted i was playing as all the easy characters and started picking my characters for me
i was STILL beating him
he ended up getting so angry that he threw his at the wall so hard it cracked open
he starts yelling calling me stupid etc
and i pretty stoned and extremely forgiving so i just kinda sit through it asking him to calm down
he yells SO loud that my comes knocking on the door and asks if everything is okay
i have to hide the bong turn on the fan open a window and quickly come up with a story to get the to fuck off
thanks for checking on us we try and keep it she leaves
i was fucken but i very much a pacifist so instead of asking him to leave like i know i should have i end up apologizing and help him pack up his switch
he does look like he has any intention of he sitting on the edge of my bed and i awkward as fuck so i just kind of stand there and make small talk with him from a few feet away
it feeling kind of normal again which i guess gives him the courage to ask if he can spend the night since it had gotten late and he had a long bus ride ahead of him
somehow i managed to assert myself and politely tell him no
surprise surprise he immediately got pissed off again grabbed his shit and promptly left
in all his rush he left his jacket
he texted me everyday for a month begging me to let him come back over at least to pick up his jacket if not to hang out again cursing me the fuck out at the end of each conversation and acting brand new every morning when he would text me again
donated his jacket to goodwill blocked him never saw him again
he seems like the type to use reddit so daniel if you reading this hi
hope ur well lmao

Well you aren t the only one on the ride
There could be a photo for every carriage or person
But yea it s still significantly less storage required plus they delete it all within the day at an amusement park whereas they probably have to hold onto it for much longer at a bank

The Governor in my state made an executive order saying no one can be evicted until the pandemic has resolved
My apartment complex is doing things like ignoring late fees and stuff for a reasonable amount of time and reducing rent by half for people who were laid off as a result of the pandemic
But they also made clear that if someone takes advantage of this and does pay at all they be evicted as soon as possible

The type of lesbian that doesnt like dick is only on one type of lesbian
There is more than one type of lesbian
Believe it or not what genital someone has is less important than their personality
And that usually what people fall in love with when they date someone
Just so you know

There are more sex toys than just dildos
And many of them dont even looks like dicks
Or even crazier they look like animal dicks

Even if a lesbian doesnt like dick they can still enjoy penetration
Something that also doesnt require a penis

Many lesbian dont have a problem with the dick itself they have a problem with who its attached too
Thank you for this
It a gift

So omg I m super fat is a mood
It s similar to I hate all my clothes and have nothing to wear and My hair looks awful today I should chop it all For me all of those secretly have overlap with I am feeling a lack of control or agency in my day to day life and this powerlessness will be expressed as a general dissatisfaction with myself and my lot in life
I will now fixate on something external in an effort to assert control in a specific area in an attempt to feel more in control in general

recipe
Mexican Casserole
Takes about an hour to make but really easy
The bake time is the killer
of ingredients will vary depending on how big your casserole dish is and how many people you feeding
bags of tortilla chips ground beef browned can Rotel can cream of mushroom soup large container sour cream bags of shredded sharp cheddar While the beef is browning Mix the Rotel cream of mushroom and sour cream in a bowl will refer to as Mix Drain the beef as best as you can
down one bag of chips for the bottom of the casserole dish
Spread the beef across for the second layer
Spread the Mix across for the layer and top off with shredded cheese
sure to get the corners really good Bake at for minutes
chips almost always end up soggy
This is where the second bag comes in
I will serve it on fresh chips I mashed down on the plate
I top my serving with a little bit of Pace Picante sauce
Really sets it off
Hope you enjoy

Going with my moms side of the family and soending time with them
I have some vague memories of going there and have some pictures w my Papa before he passed away some years later
I havent been since i was
That was back in
Shit im getting old
Gud for you man keep going
Legitimately the scene in Bridge to Terabithia where the family is in the living room sobbing because they thought their kid was dead and it s revealed that the girl drowned in the creek

Not a fear but it s definitely there

There are around to bank branches plus maybe credit unions
in the US
And maybe what rides that take your picture

Definitely a small fraction of the number of bank branches
Rides also know exactly where you going to be and which way you be facing
A bank has to cover the whole building from multiple angles
How many cameras in a bank on average


Does even matter blows the number of amusement park cameras out of the water
Then as others have pointed out banks are selling you your picture for
And bank robberies really are all that common
And I have even brought up storage costs as others have also mentioned
So in total it is simply not worth it to banks to have cameras of the same quality as amusement park rides
It would be massively more expensive for little return on investment

Bet on Trump and Cubs winning the country in and you be set for life but RIP DAD GUN OUT OF ITS HIDING SPOT NOW

No but it is in Illinois

Okay then I think you re just making desperate attempts to force society to justify your sexual perversion
Furthermore I think everyone has a choice to be gay or not
You may be attracted to men and still choose to be straight
It is a choice
Now if you want to say you re to be gay then that to me is just victim mentality and more evidence of attempting to force society to justify your behavior
It s like you ve either got ta accept that you choose to be gay or accept that you re being forced genetically environmentally however people get the gay to carry the burden of gay
Do you own it snap or does the gay own you
Thanks for sharing this
That s awesome

Not too bad but in hindsight the Bible sitting on the dashboard of his car actually ended up being a very clear indication when right before our next planned day date he explained to me that we should go ahead and part metaphorical ways when I made an offhand comment about mushrooms the day before with friends and having the best time and he was not into someone who d do that Like I said not the worst but looking back on our one wonderful date I shouldn t have ignored the fact that having something as big as the Bible sliding around on your dashboard ready to become a launch missile at the moment of foul play was dangerous and spoke volumes of his priorities as well as being kind of an odd more of a safety blanket

By that time cars had replaced horse drawn buggies by a few decades even in rural Texas
Although I suppose his family could still have chosen to drive a horse drawn buggy to church
The only reason I say anything is I find that many young Redditors are a little vague about what the world was like in the early century
Dust to dust

Ex control room operator standard is six months also depends on the quality of the footage often businesses skimp on decent cctv gear and go for cheap low res systems which ultimately does help in the slightest
Where as theme park photo cameras are often very high quality setups as patrons wo be willing to shell out for shit quality pictures
I also ran into a women on a date that began talking about practicing the dark arts and witchcraft
She then proceed later in the date that she was a prostitute looking for a real man not a client
Which then turned into her confessing she does favors for her land Lord and his wife
And theeenn she was hell bent on having me over for dinner
Like highly hell bent on cooking for me

These people are confused by their sexuality or in denial
Weird that Reddit sees sexuality as binary for how liberal it is
I bisexual
I have multiple friends who are straight but have basically a fetish when it comes to dick
They love to get guys off but the idea of kissing or cuddling with another man to them would be the same as a guy who straight who only sleeps with women
They are in denial and normally just say they are bi to people because most only see the world in options
Sexual orientation just became a widely socially accepted thing in the last years or so still a lot of misinformation out there
Most people now know you ca discriminate against gay people but other then that their views have changed since they did

the thing I keep forgetting is we are talking items that in most cases we do not need for survival and even when we do corporations are trying to market and sell to us at prices that much higher than the actual cost to produce and there no way they are going to let taxes factor into that marketing

This guy and I met online and started talking and we really hit it off
A few weeks later I went to his place and we watched some movies and made out a bit
This guy was perfect he was funny and sweet and good looking but when we made out I felt nothing at all
By the end of the date I had realized that if I not attracted to a guy like this there no way I attracted to guys at all
I did wan na ghost this guy but after some thought I knew it was gon na work so I texted him a few days later that I realized that I was a lesbian after our date
Which even though it the total truth I now realize was probably an awful thing to say to him
Poor guy probably thinks the date was so bad he turned me into a lesbian

Sandwiches get their name from the legend that John Mantagu the Earl of Sandwich was so addicted to gambling that he asked for all his meals to be put between bread so he could eat it with one hand while he gambled with the other
Food historians believe he was inspired to ask for is food to be served this way by observing pita sandwiches during his travels in the Eastern Mediterranean
Like a hot dog bun pita bread is sliced apart but rather sliced open and filled
So yes a hot dog is a sandwich according to the Earl standards

Are you curious as to what crazy answers Reddit can come up with
Genitals hang out of you body
I need to have an even number in my magazine
Probably just ocd
Ketchup chips
It was earth all along
Wait you get hit on
Doing the same thing while being in a beautiful cabin in the pitch black woods too dark to even leave cuz the tree branches oh they get you while watching HGTV for hours with ur slightly less dosed friends who are being silent while you personally are heavily critiquing the production design and taking moments in your irate but laughable monologue of madness to take the time to compliment the choice of granite and how it really brings out the kitchen facade is an equally opening up the mind experience though I will sure say probably a different universe altogether
Shades of Grey
I think you know who s not the muppet
Got ta make the beta for the swing traders
Women are you wearing for the men or for all the other women and it some kind of competition
And how expensive is it all and how on earth do you have the time to apply it
It fascinates and repels me at the same time
When I taught year olds I got it all the time
I also got Dad and even Nana once at the ripe old age of
It depends on who their main caregiver is at home
Now I teach high school and still get it maybe once every couple of weeks
Part of it is because all the kids call me Miss so mum isn t that far off it and also it s that split second thing that most kids have spent their entire lives with mum being the person in charge and the person who answers their questions in the first few years of life
I also have a group of kids who call me their school mum because they come to me for advice and I nag them about their uniforms doing their work etc
As a person with no children it is nice to have that sort of impact on kids
Kill bill when the eye was pulled out and squished between toes
My dad worked at a theater and as a kid I snuck into that scene as my first r rated movie
Threw up
Had nightmares for months
Even as an adult that scene still kinda fucks with my head
Clown puppet in the original Poltergeist film basically the whole thing was traumatic
if he called her a land whale that make him an asshole but it seems that despite his disgust at her appearance he still showed her a good time
He took the bullet not for his wingman but for the girl emotional

I just finish working a overnight shift and have to pick up some things at the supermarket before heading home
One of them things that I need is spaghetti noodles because my year old loves her pasta
So I head down the pasta aisle and here is this woman dressed in a yellow raincoat with the hood up safety googles on mask on and those yellow dishwashing gloves on loading her cart with boxes of spaghetti
I must have counted boxes minimum
So I say to her you mind if I just grab two boxes
She looks at me and says My family has to eat
I said politely I just need two boxes and your cart is full
Her response
Are you becoming aggressive with me
I just walked away shaking my head as she continued emptying the shelf of spaghetti noodles
Forrest Gump
But keep Tom Hanks
Cash money
Good hygiene
There was this guy I didn t like that much wasn t sure why but he constantly smelled of sweat and just genuinely bad

Also being polite
All of the classic simp stuff like holding doors and using manners
I enjoy taking apart old electronics and collecting the circuit boards
Animal dick is still dick
Bisexual women have an excuse
I dont care if you dont like men
The idea that you dont like men but like the idea of sex with men is fucked
There are infinitely less toys that penetrate that arent shaped like dicks than those that are
Bottom line is make a choice
You either like men and their parts or you dont

At least for the second one it a thing where they swipe right on literally everybody that shows up so they can count the number of people that swiped right on them for a boost
Coz it s weird
Mass Effect Andromeda
It not a bad game and the quests are fun the first time you get there
I do think it be played a second time though
Some of the choices do not have the consequence value I am looking for like they did in the original trilogy
Also some conversions seemed like forced ideological throatfucks like when Ryder mocks his pilot for worshiping Jesus
Still I hope Bioware will make another Mass Effect game
the world would be made of fingers to chew on and earrings to rip out of ears the ground would be made of pepper seeds and the sky filled with colorful wooden blocks there would always be laughing humans to mimic and no newspapers or brooms would exist
They deserve more recognition

welcome to Unfortunately even a mild bedroom is a curse that plagues libido'
To put it bluntly in the situation where all parties are consenting and interested if one party is not considering the others' desires to be intimate statistically it is not likely they ever will be considerate
Be it stress schedule situational if the partner is a priority they will make their wants fulfilled
And then the vicious cycle of want and denial and you hate yourself again for being so desperate that you figure it must be you who is undesirable
But wait there is that one sexy chick who gives you the eyes could it mean TL DR there has to be givers who are good at prioritizing the important things like
Not learned so much as confirmed that society is so much more fragile than we think
My wife cried and that s why I made the mistake of marrying her
I didn t want to be that asshole who rejected her
Luke doesn t make it through Episode
Burns refuses to spend on a replacement safety valve
The reactor melts up and causes a cloud of radioactive steam to cover the town
Meanwhile over at the Homer has just finished eating a new atomic brand burrito imported from Venezuela
The mystery meat in the burrito causes Homer to have explosive gas
He begins to fart and belch uncontrollably and the gas from his body is able to neutralize the radioactive cloud covering Springfield
Thus saving the people for another something years of antics
Homer is given the key to the city pizza restaurant and a giant parade in front of Moe
As the parade passes by Ned comments that he has never been more shocked in his life
Nothing on this whole diddly darn planet could shock me more that Homer Simpsons saving the town
Then Rod announces that he is gay and Todd tells Ned that he wants to be called Louise
Ned just trembles as the rest of the town goes off into the sunset cheering for Homer

For my crush to ride my face while she gropes my breasts Though I would settle for a hug
I stronglyyyy agree with this ahaha social media and over all having easy access to anything we want on our phones can cause so many problems
About years ago I was at Target and a young girl in line of front of me had a old baby
She had cans of baby formula in her cart that was it nothing else
She tried to pay with food stamps but they weren t valid or they were expired or something
Anyways she was visibly broken but trying not to fall apart in public
She was going to walk out of the store with nothing all she was trying to do was feed her baby
So I bought them for her
I had no idea how expensive baby formula was but she was so grateful and bawled her eyes out
I never get to share that story thank you

Yes but how do you know tons of women in your life have had abortions
You do because it is something that they bring up obviously Men do probably do it more even if you discount abortion or anything like that but women literally being able to say Nope not pregnant anymore in comparison to men either becoming dads or becoming deadbeats is at least part of the reason it so much more common for men
Pie
a corndog is infinite sides of bread
I guess just going through the motions is what motivates me
I take each day on day at a time and each step I take one step at a time
By simply just going through the motions and living in the moment my quality of life has skyrocketed and my desire to kill myself has diminished greatly
Just enjoy life for what it is

Hysterical is NOT an offensive term
The problem is hysterical people do want to hear the truth because it hurts their feelings and makes them not in control of the situation
Any call to a PD about the offensive use of this term will result in nothing

Black Snake Moan I torn between keeping Samuel L Jackson and watching as he attempts to keep a mentally damaged necrophilic Muppet chained up in his home Keep Christina Ricci and watch as she sexually aggresses a bunch of Muppets and then finds an unlikely kinship with the Muppet that shackles her with chains in his home

First you take a bunch of synthetic hormones which will give you cancer in fifteen years
Then you pay a fuck load of money to have a doctor violate their hippocratic oath to mutilate your body
Then you regret your decision and become suicidally depressed because you realize that you are any happier and now you permanently altered your body for nothing
Can I have a backstory for this never ending hatred
Just curious

how a horror story that was fixed by the hoa
condo above us was inhabited by chain smokers
their deck was littered with cigarette butts as was the alley three stories below
and our balcony
they never cleaned so they would fall through cracks and over the edge
they would also flick their ash and embers even when we were outside
one night while enjoying dinner on our balcony a still burning cigarette butt was flicked into the wind and landed in my wife salad
i went off expletives
then went upstairs and started banging on their door
of course no answer
took it to the condo board with evidence in hand
also snapped pictures of the their balcony from the roof before they had a chance to clean
and the alley below
they were fined by the condo board and given a final warning
apparently they had caused problems with their smoking for other neighbors before
i attended the meeting and it was amazing
they were pissed said they would pay
board told them if they did pay then a lien would be placed on their condo
never had a problem again which was actually surprising
guess they just bought an ashtray like normal fucking humans
You just gave them Coronavirus homie
No its right now but ive been awake for hours
maybe they re trying to pretend they re one of us

I moved to a much cheaper place to live where i can actually support me and my wife on pay
and things will only get better once she finds herself a job as well
If she found a job tomorrow we could pay down all of our debts by the end of the year since her income could all go towards the debts

I saw no one mention this and felt it might be interesting to know a pregnant woman can be impregnated a second time and carry two foetuses of different age
Called superfetation the chance of this happening is incredibly unlikely with recorded cases being in the low double digits
As such it can actually happen which I find to be a rather fascinating thought

Lack of education and a culture that rebuffs any criticism of mental ability
Would all Marxism be since Marx wrote his ideas in to industrial capitalism
But anyway I say our current crisis is increasingly proving Marx correct
So many of the problems currently inflicting the United States in particular exist because our society is set up predominantly to benefit the wealthy not the people as a whole
I Am Legend

I would build a monument to dem titties

WHY
BECAUSE I CAN
Pretty much everything I own except my dog since she s a mutt
I m Batman
Snitches get stitches
I watched all of those when they came out so yeah
Good call
Love is what shapes us most
Whether it s family friends and a SO
The feeling of betrayal is one you ll remember but in the long run stay optimistic
Everything bad will have a good outcome
I m not saying trust issues are bad but don t shut people out
Because if you shut everyone out you ll hurt someone who loves you
You ll hurt the one that actually was one
And for what
The trade of a loving mate until death do you part over not wanting to be hurt again
Is that what anyone wants
If so go on with your life shutting people out and eventually go from hating others to being hated
By others and eventually by yourself
Sorry this wasn t directed at anyone specifically
I ve just been seeing too many people letting feelings take over and starting down this path

My bipolar is so bad especially right now with covid
I dreamed that my boyfriend and I were walking in a field on a sunny day
We found a large old white barn
We went inside
To our horror we found kids in dog cages kids being tortured killed and worse
There were men standing around with knives
They looked like they were dripping with blood
We turned and ran outside we jumped into a white truck
My uncle Jay that I loved who is now dead jumped into the front seat with me
My boyfriend was in the backseat
I was scared panicked
I drove through the field
Seeing some people I jumped out of the truck running towards them screaming
We have to save the children we have to save the Then I heard the shots
I realized my uncle Jay shot me times in the back
I stumbled the first person I got to was my cousin Christie Jay daughter
She just looked at me and rolled her eyes
Then I saw her smile
I realized she would not help
I then stumbled to the next person I saw who was my in law Barbara
She caught me as I fell to the ground
She said yes we will find the children
My boyfriend was still stuck in the truck he is disabled and could not help us
I could hear myself whimpering in real life
Finally I woke up so disturbed
My dog ever faithful heard me whimpering and had her little nose tucked under my chin comforting me with a little nudge and a lick
Thank you Lord that was only a nightmare
I pray no one is living like that
But I know it happens in real life and it makes me cry

Having the powers of a god and torturing the world with those powers
Killing all the animals that live there using their insides the grow plants and cutting them

And when you are bored just destroying the world and starting a new genocide

I was playing monkey sound effects before the teacher joined and I turned the sound effects off just before the teacher joined
The monkey noises accidentally made a surprise reappearance five minutes later after I turned my phone back on
I had a guy ask me this
I proceeded to flip out but it was just bad timing
He did take the condom off he was just OCD about birth control and was asking if I was on another form of it in addition
Many favorites but definitely one of my all times is the memory of waking up in the north georgia mountains back when I was in college
There was a thin layer of dew over everything
A solid two hours before the sun rises up I wake up to lay my sleeping bag out open in the grass and watch the open night sky covered in many stars and moon transition into the sun rise
A beautiful canvas of orange yellow purple and blue slowly taking over the night until it bloomed into a bright clear morning with the wind flowing through the trees as the birds continue their songs
Moments like that made me believe in forever maintaining meaning in life because the world we live in was too beautiful not to have meaning while alive in it
Never had a match
Damn betting on trump and the Cubs would bet you a pretty penny

He won t turn back around until I scratch his chin

I really wish that did suck
The problem with trying to have intelligent discussions on free sites is that you get too many people who think they know what they talking about but actually do
They drop big buzz words randomly in places hoping that using big words can make up for not actually knowing things
And when you call them out on their bullshit they start flaming on you
King of the whoooo
no doubt that some are cynical and hate women
Your insinuation that all cops are that way is not consistent with my experience
I know the saying goes he ll treat his mom like he lol treat you or something but personally I can not date a mommas boy
Like sure love your mom and your family but have a healthy level of independence from them
I feel it more every day
There s nothing interesting going on in life anymore
I m not a kid anymore and I have responsibilities but I also have college to worry about
I should just drop out of college and get a job and not be in fuck tons of debt in the long run
I don t even get anything out of school
I have a hard time focusing and I just don t give a shit

It s hard to be original right now
Sure it might be nice with a supercar but i still need to get a license it would be nice with an apartment of smaller house with cleaning service but that s not very attractive
I would love an endless supply i could spend on games feel like i m really rich but that s kind of cheating
A new super computer setup would be nice but kind of pointless right now
I can t pay the game development school to let me in but if i could i would certainly do that
What would be really cool and semi original is a large arsenal of airsoft equipment all the good stuff for someone with glasses oh and a travel service
Now that i think about it corona is limiting groupups so that might be difficult
I guess i m kind of out of ideas
Actually i have one last chance and i know just the thing

idk man
its about space specifically recording space for digital cameras
its ok for a bank to have cameras with recording on it that is digital but it eats harddrive space and you have to save it up to a month so they save it as the lowest resolution possible
think of a movie you have downloaded it can be anywhere between to for blue ray quality
now think about that in terms of months or years your looking at TB or even PB of data from the camera that needs to be stored for years now your going to be paying millions upon millions for that kind of system to catch bank robber that may never come to your bank
where as high speed cameras take a pick that may be MB for one photo and then after mins if you dont buy it or are waiting in line to buy it its just deleted

Great because all the stuff listed is awesome not so great when you try to socialize with others your age

He had the best time
It s just really a great time
No fancy sets no lip singing no changing of clothes
He crowd surfs and lets kids come and sing with him
He reads the signs fans make and keeps some
And sometimes drinks a fans beer

I don t know if I just wasn t paying attention or not but here we go
In season of the walking dead around episode
Daryl escapes from the Saviors and makes it back to the Hilltop with Jesus
Rick and a bunch of other people from Alexandria are trying to revolt against the Saviors and make their way to Hilltop to negotiate
This is where they find out Daryl escaped and after discussing their plans on killing the Saviors they head to the Kingdom
There they talk to King Ezekiel where he declines in being involved but offers to keep Daryl hidden since the Saviors are trying to find him and since the Saviors don t step foot in the Kingdom
So Daryl is ordered by Rick to stay at the Kingdom and he does for a few episodes but then all of a sudden in episode I think he s at Hilltop
I don t know if I had accidentally looked over this but it confuses the hell out of me

Hmm
Technically it s correct
If something happened it was meant to because it did happen
If something didn t happen it wasn t meant to because it didn t happen
If you look at it that way
It s a comforting thought
It doesn t really reveal or tell you anything
It just makes you feel that if something didn t happen it wasn t meant to be so you don t have to feel bad about it not happening
Sure
What is up Jimmy
Husband thought he could trim my sons hair
Didn t realize settings on a beard trimmer that he had were different than a regular hair trimmer
Accidentally shaved a patch bald and at that point had to keep going

Yeah I m totally listening What s plus then Yeah
Wait so I confused was it a hack dentist or did you have serious problems with your teeth and all of them legitimately needed to be removed
Obviously I not entitled to a reply in any way but if you open to it could you explain more about the reason the dentist suggested removing all of your teeth and how you came to accept the procedure
For example did you get a second opinion
Did you take a long time to decide that you were going to go through with the procedure
Yea I agree everyone has baggage now a days from previous relationships experimenting can be good sometimes but people just seem to be more careless of others feelings when doing so in modern day relationships
Around or
Why are women so afraid to make the move when it comes to dating like even asking a guy out is something of women wo do for some reason
Pirates of the Caribbean keep Johnny Depp as human and rest of the cast as Muppets

Common and uncommon interests
Common so you have stuff to do talk about
Otherwise you just sit in the same room on your phones
Uncommon so you can get away from each other
Just because you are in a relationship or even married does not mean you have to spend every second together
It is healthy to get away and to do things apart from time to time especially if you live together

Modern Warfare I played that game so much whenever I think back to playing that game with my old friends I haven t talked to in years it gives me this weird nostalgia it s just the perfect game in my eyes
Probably more so because of the memories I associate with it but it s still awesome nonetheless
I still pop it into my old sometimes and play a match with a buddy

I forgot what I grabbed but it was a wrong pan size upon presenting the box of baking sugar to my mom almost immediately she asks me when am I gon na fucking grow up and blah blah blah I honestly forget what growing up had to do with brownie mix so I calmly opened the box took out the bag and punted that shit all over her back porch then said something like now you got zero by zero brownies
then left this was NEVER spoken of since
I watch like planet earth and blue planet and life
How about you stranger
I disagree with your reasoning though not your end conclusion
Travelling solo means that you are experiencing things all on your own the memories you make are for you alone
You can share them with someone if they show interest but really it just for you
Travelling with someone you are experiencing everything together yeah you can definitely reminisce on it together but it a different sort of reminiscing and the experience itself being shared is different than if you were to do it alone
By being alone you see that part of the world through your eyes only
The memories I made travelling alone for myself are very dear to me more dear than just about any trip over taken with others
Even though I ca share them with people
Though I definitely love travelling with my wife over alone

It was literally fucking math english history and FUCKING GRADE ENGLISH
idk how the fuck grade english us available in highschool but whatever
Anyways after math class the school turned into a bouncy castle so i did what any stable person would do and layed there in silence
After atleast a minute of it a teacher said are you ok and after that if felt like a lady gaga music video with plot sense and flashing colors
My last words were im fine Jones and then i woke up

You wake up with amnesia after trying to commit suicide by shoving a banana through your head so you could kill your family with said banana accompanying you as your conscience
He disappeared under mysterious circumstances
Been watching him since I was like
The Sun is really bright and indoor lights are not
An outdoor area is at least a hundred times and could be a thousand times brighter than the bank lobby
With so much less light to work with something has to give
The camera isn t magic
The options are
Increase exposure time causing motion blur
Use a larger aperture causing more of the room to be out of focus
Increase the gain on the sensor causing noise in the image They all degrade image quality
Generally the best results will come from doing some of each
You cant fool me anymore
too many to list
Not true
Smashed my baby momma one time when she was months pregnant

I was playing with a leaky battery one time as a kid and rubbed my eyes

On a second viewing when you know what going on the fact that the plot is strung together with twine and chewing gum becomes apparent
One stupid bit I did pick up on in the first run through was the that Morgan Freeman character thought he had to go to the Library of Congress to read Dante but I excused it at the time
On rewatching it it only occurred to me how much that idiocy was of a piece with the rest of the movie
Why did they expell you was it a stupid reason
Castlevania sotn
Chrono Trigger
Not allowed in my state lol
Big Lebowski Jeff Bridges and a buncha Muppets
Yep tp to make wet globs to throw up on the ceiling
Availability of food distribution and harvest sizes
Not to mention we learned how to make just about everything out of corn
The ones without cure
That like being given a notice your life subscription is about to end
Nah
My life is boring but it could be a lot worse if I became a productive member of society
It s either that or death which is the main cause of my sad feelings
The first thing you need to do before you can love yourself is to accept yourself and everyday say good things about yourself
I get that it sounds like typical therapist but it works and have a mantra to say that gives you positive vibes I ve been around alcoholics most of my life and have heard the AA mantra a lot God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the I m not religious but I have used it a lot to help me when I m down
By no means should you just use the internet seek the help you need
Life is not always good but It s worth it to stick around to the end so you can smile at the good times and laugh that you had been questioning life
I think he was murdered
I want people to know how unimportant they are to me
look on the bright side of life Whistle Always look on the light side of life Whistle
Saving private Ryan keep Tom hanks
at guess we fucked then
It not thing
The typical answer is communication
But if you communicate by screaming and yelling it wo work
Love communication understanding willingness to work things out forgiveness
NOT EVEN CLOSE
Eat and drink
Clout
Not mine but my younger brother
When we were younger he asked me to give him a haircut
We were pretty retarded kids and I grabbed the scissors and went ham believing that we both knew what I was doing
In the end his head looked like a leopard with those circular black spots on his head
To my relief my Mexican mother did not hit me but rather laughed and shaved my brother bald
Good times
They all have their noses in their phones and do even notice each other
So they know I read it
Thank you so so much
My lifelong best friend was diagnosed July with Glioblastoma EXTREMELY aggressive brain cancer and she was told she had a month left
Surgery is an option nor is radiation
Chemo was on the table but it did work like it should have
Recently she has been getting worse
She was originally on hospice but taken off it because she kept getting better and better
But now she is
Now she keeps getting worse and worse
She sleeps wakes up to throw up and she goes back to sleep
She is back in hospice and is doing well at all
This is her third round with cancer but we are nearing the end of her fight
We do know when only that it will likely be sometime soon
Me and her plus our other best friend have been super closer since we were babies
We are teenagers now but that is part of what makes me so mad
We are only teenagers
I know not everyone gets that long and we should feel lucky for what time we do have but we were supposed to go to college and be roommates and then eventually start families of our own and then our kids would be raised like sisters and brothers together
We were supposed to have so much time and so many adventures left
We were supposed to grow old and then travel the world together and be crazy and hilarious like the old ladies from Mamma Mia
She is supposed to die of cancer
This is how the story was supposed to go
I guess to often we forget that we are not the painter of our fate but rather the canvas
I just do know how to process this grief
Within a matter of days she could be gone
I just feel so alone with all this social isolation then having to process this on top of everything else
like if someone is asking you about something personal
You ca say badass stores and not elaborate
Currently away from most of my gaming setup and books helping take care of relatives
Do get me wrong they good people but there is a definite generation gap
Makes it hard to relate and share
So yeah currently too bored to sleep
How bad is that
Look up spoink it s a big on a spring with a ball of its head

Honestly any of them Hoenn seems like the nicest but Sinnoh has a nice balance of everything so I d probably go with one of them
Sorry for the delay
Apparently my phone decided not to notify me of the response
There is kind of a long back story
I had my first child this last summer and my doctor decided to induce me
I had a day long induction which is days is apparently considered a fail and usually results in a cesarean before finally having my baby
I was on pitocin and IV fluids the whole time
After having the baby they kept forcing me to drink a ton of liquid
My legs feet and ankles were so swollen that I could barely move but the hospital staff didn t seem to care and told me that everything I was going through was normal
My body did not have anywhere to store all the excess fluids so it ended up on my heart and Lungs
days after we were released I kept feeling like I was suffocating Any time that I would lay down so my husband convinced me to go to the ER
I thought I was just being a major whimp because of how convincing the hospital was but I ended up going in
It was a good thing I did because my heart rate was in the low bpm
I live in rural Montana so they decided to life flight me to a bigger city because I was in heart failure
Then I bottomed our a couple times in the hospital on the way there
Scariest part is that I didn t even notice
I felt normal other than the leg pain and feeling like I was suffocating when I would lay down
My uncle
The entire years I knew him he was single
He was honestly the most happy chill guy I knew

I hated him for so long he stayed in bed for YEARS while his family struggled barely having food and leaving in complete poverty with what seemed like no wait out
Having said family wait on him hand and foot giving him food and a warm bed you can tell they did really many beds would be surprised if it was the only bed
Why else would they have four sick elderly folk on one bed if they had others
So essentially he made sure he got to stay in the only bed with a full belly while not really needing to
Once the opportunity came up to go do something amazing he can not only get up but do an ENTIRE song and dance routine
He just a very selfish jerk clearly only looking out for himself PS if there are any grammatical mistakes I apologise I half asleep on mobile and quite frankly lazy

A popular television show from when homer and Marge were kids is getting released to streaming and the town is alive with all the adults quoting it and bringing our the show merchandise
Bart thinks it lame only for Lisa to bring up the parallels between the show and itchy and scratchy
Bart plays it off cool but begins to grow worried
The week leading up he become more worried backing up itchy and scratchy revisiting old toys and things he loved but grew beyond
Finally the night of the premiere Bart breaks down to Homer about his fear is the show ending but that life is going to be different
Homer embraces his son and gives him a speech
He explains that things have changed a lot since he last saw it
Things have gotten worse but a lot has improved too
He did have Marge or the kids but now he would trade them for the chance to go back
That even if his favorite show got cancelled tomorrow he still have the memories the laughs that made him cry or the tears that stopped because of a joke and most importantly he still have his family
That it does matter what you watch it those you watch with that are important
Cut to an older Bart coming home to a familiar but different front room
Sitting down with his wife and children and ad for a limited rerelease of the itchy scratchy movie and his own son asking him what it is

The biggest difference tends to be shutter speed
Cameras designed for still images tend to have a higher shutter speed which eliminates a lot of motion blur
And unfortunately you ca assume the same resolution
You would generally have to shoot video in to get the same resolution that even a lower end DSLR can achieve which would be prohibitively expensive on terms of the storage required for footage

You have to be a boy to do that
Man I broken so many rules
Well before my hubs and I got together he was at a bar with coworkers
The waitress was wearing a sports jersey and one guy called out To her I am not a X fan but I can change she rolled her eyes and started to walk away so my husband doesn t miss a beat he says I m not straight but for you I can change with a big ol shit eating grin
She laughed turned around and started talking with the group of guys
I like that he is so quick on his feet when talking to people

Slap down a pitcher of water and run
I did see the accident but I saw the aftermath
My grandfather on my father side was one of those sorts who prized and never complaining over almost everything else
He was building a large new equipment shed on his property when he was in his eighties and was manhandling a steal girder into place
It slipped dropped and sliced his thigh to the bone
He stitched himself up with his wife sterilizing the tools
When I saw the massive scar a decade later he recovered from the injury completely
I guess I m not meaning to point out being socially awkward I was that person and being around a crush is different I think that the borderline red pill type approach to women as of speaking f to them like they would themselves or a friend is out of the question if that makes sense
It s like the women who expect men to be this unattainable prince doing everything for them or acting a certain way

Since you didn t specify in your story I m just going to pretend that when you woke up you realized the boat is still floating in the harbor so in a finale truly fit for a tale as odd as what you already experienced you had to quickly yet quietly awkwardly slide into the water and swim still half drunk back to the dock and walking up to the drive thru of the coffee shop absolutely soaking wet but mildly amused at the absurdity of it all
Any threat of serious threat of danger is traumatizing

When I was a kid my aunt and uncle would usually throw really big parties for the of July
My family used to have a farm so we own a lot of acres so we all lived on the property just opposite ends
Spent a lot of time at their house
Anyway at one point my aunt has this new friend
Probably shouldn t say her actual name so I ll just call her Betty
Now we were children
We were not given a huge in depth talk about Betty
The best we got was Betty was born a man and now they wear Cool
Go Betty
Do you
We met Betty for the first time before the of July party I mentioned
My little cousin was actually at my house and we were playing outside
We had a lemonade stand even though that was stupid
A rural ass farm in the middle of nowhere lemonade stands aren t a thing
We didn t even make the lemonade
It was a store bought jug
We probably were selling it for less than it cost
Anyway someone pulled up
Bought some lemonade
Started asking a bunch of questions about my aunt
It was Betty
My cousin didn t seem weirded out by it so I thought oh she knows of Betty this is yeah no
That wasn t the case
Turns out that Betty was someone my aunt and uncle met on a swingers website online
They just logged on to chat and mess with people and had no intention of meeting in person
They mentioned enough details for Betty to figure out where they lived and she tracked them down
Mind you we didn t know this as kids
I just found this out a few years ago
Back to the past
My aunt weirdly enough welcomes Betty into her life
I don t know why
That s a creepy first encounter
But they get close over a few months maybe it was weeks idk I was a kid and there are rumors about there being an affair not entirely sure
Who knows
But it s causing a rift between her and my uncle
It gets to the point where he s threatening to leave her he wanted to get a trailer and put it behind our house to get his kids away from the situation
Tensions were rising as July was approaching
of July Betty shows up at the party
My uncle was drunk and that was the last straw
Shit hit the fan
He went crazy
I don t really remember much of it
I remember being taken home after fireworks and then shortly after my mom being on the phone freaking out
Then my uncle showing up on our porch drunk and crying
He smashed my aunts computer
Betty called the cops on him because she knew about his weeds plants in his garden
He went and tore up all the plants
Got into an argument and that s when he came to our house
As far as I know my aunt was on Betty s side
I think my gram and mom had to talk sense into my aunt about Betty
It was weird how she just strolled into their lives
She s causing nothing but trouble
Stop it
So as far as I know she tries cutting her out of her life
Haven t heard about Betty in months and one day she shows up at my house when it was just my cousin sister and I home alone
We were scared
My mom was like just lock the door
She ll go Like still
what
That s all
Okay mom thanks
We were trying to spy on her without being seen as she s walking all around my yard looking for something
Maybe us
I don t know
She eventually leaves and I think she went up to my aunt s house
I think she started to be more firm about going away
For weeks months even betty s car would constantly drive up and down our road
We d see it parked at a pull off a few miles away with no one in it one can only assume she walked to stalk
Etc
I have had thoughts that maybe my aunt didn t completely cut her off but I don t know for sure
Enough time has passed without seeing Betty we just forget about her
Years pass even
Then one day she shows up at my aunt s job and makes a scene
Not sure how she knew where my aunt worked
My aunt could have told her but who knows she s asked to leave
My aunt drives home from work and makes it almost the whole way home and she starts being harassed by an aggressive driver
They keep trying to cause a wreck and trying to run her off the road
My aunt called my uncle to be ready at the drive way
It ended up being fucking Betty
Anyway yeah I m sure I m forgetting a lot of details
My aunt is now friends with Betty on fucking Facebook
Fucking scorpion
Yeah I m still mad

Really you and a few others here are just proving the point
Racism by definition is believing that a race is inferior or superior to another
You generally believe that they are inferior to you
You actually think because of their skin color alone they ca succeed in the same circumstances a white person is in and also i guess a white person ca fail
That makes you a racist
Get out really had subtext about this but I sure you did even notice it
And how is Oedipus these days
This occurred sometime during the year that occured

Honestly was thinking it be funnier if all humans and dinosaurs were muppets except the
Alien those motherfucker need to go insvan someone esle plant
From the ages of when I could retain memory s to I had sleep paralysis every night I had a variety of dreams but only some where recurring ones sorry for the grammatical errors in advance was a tall huge man about feet tall in a black trench coat and a fedora fuck if I know why that scared me with an all white face kind of like with no features just a blank white face
He would come into my room and slowly walk up to me where he would just stand over me
he wouldn t ever do anything and never touched me he just stood over me and stared
This would last for a few hours then he would just turn and leave I honestly have no idea where this started and why it kept happening
second I can remember is a giant spider that would jump from each of the corners of my room I could only see it was the shape of a spider but it s body was pitch black it would shake and then turn into thousands of tiny centipedes and spiders that would crawl on me and go between my fingernails eyes nose and mouth
That one was probably the worst
I can t really remember the smaller ones just bits and pieces of creepy kid shit

Best of wishes bro
Uh the roof I think you kinda phrased the question weird
It the godzilla pokemon what not to love
Sooo randomly match with this girl like hours away from my house she was in my town one weekend when we matched
Well we hit it off and after a week or so of chatting we decide to meet up
She s nervous about the date so I agreed to just tag along to a dinner bday party for one of her friends
So I drive hours down to her place to pick her up for the evening
Well when I get to her apt complex she tells me where to park so I don t get towed remember this part
Now when I initially meet her she s about lbs heavier than her posted pics and ones we snapped showed
I m not really shallow so it wasn t a deal breaker just felt lied too
Then come to find out she s got a very annoying voice high pitched and naisely
Those combined I was ready to text my buddy but decided to see it through bc she was a nice girl
Well we get to dinner with her friends and I proceed to get interrogated for the entire time and since I m the only guy there it s awkward as hell
I m about ready to toss in the towel when she tells me they are going bar hopping and if I m willing to go she ll buy my drinks all night but if I wanted to leave she could get a ride with one of her friends
I told her she came with me I d take her home and that I can buy my own drinks and she s my date
So we proceed to bar hopping with her friends as they all proceed to get hammered and I end up driving everyone around to these bars and having a drink here or there
Finally after they are all trashed we go back to her place and everyone else retires to the couches or their rooms and we go to hers well she gets frisky bc of the alcohol and we go a round
Next morning I get up at am to leave bc I have work to go to and try to make a quick exit bc I m over all the drama there was plenty of it all exes included
Well I walk outside and find my truck gone
It was TOWED
And tow company doesn t open until
So I have to go back to her apt and sit and wait for hours while these hungover girls wan na talk about all the drama all over again and keep asking my opinions
Finally she drives me to the tow company and dollars later I can leave to go home
Got miles down the road and texted her it wasn t gon na work out
For me it s either Witcher Bastion Guild Wars or Bioshock Infinite

Secondly if you on Grindr trying to fuck dudes you probably gay

I just not interested in dating
I like to be able to make decisions without having to consult someone about it and I generally prefer being alone
How do you propose that
I was in an abusive relationship for years
It was both physical and mentally abusive
I was young when we got together and thought I loved him
I was told by him I was worthless no one else could ever want me and that I was lucky to have him
When one of his girlfriends would show up at our house he would beat me up for being mad about it
One night I came home from work to find him sitting in the dark with a loaded shotgun waiting for me
He was going to kill me
The reason was that I had found a phone message from one of his married girlfriends
I contacted the husband and let him know what was going on
It was none of my business and now I was going to pay
The night ended with me being choked until I passed out
When I would not wake up with a beer being poured over my head he panicked and called
I woke up in an ambulance
Of course police got involved he was arrested
It took me almost losing my life to finally realized this was not a relationship I wanted to be in
I left literally
All my stuff I left at the house we had shared
I was afraid if I went back at all I would be leaving in a body bag
That was
I went through several years of therapy and it was a long road back
But today I am a stronger person for it
I recognize when someone is in an abusive relationship and I understand that until that person is truly ready to leave all we can do is love them and be there for them

Also depends on the question and stakes here
Saving private ryan keep Tom Hank
I was wrong simple as that
I not going to be an ass to you because of mistake
Lol That seems like a good idea
I would make sure that you understand the metrics of what makes up someones mental health
Ask them what their mental health was like before this happened did they have anything stressful happen before etc etc
For this preliminary data I would have them both rank it numerically specify the event
Especially as I would assume you would ask what kinds of events they had happen the crisis following the same format
For any of their options I would give them drop down
give them an other section just in case their situation is complicated but do be aware you probably have to decode their explanation to fit into your dataset if you go this route
I ask for wages place of employment Remote Worker etc etc
This seems like a really good opportunity to get some really fine data
And hey if you want it mapped out let me know
I not the best at GIS there are certainly others out there that know more but I not the shabbiest either

Satan if we lucky
I graduated and overall did fine
But it was a hell of a lot of money in student loans Parents could help and I also used all my life savings and almost all the money from my summer job each summer with no job prospects
I went with a major almost on a whim
I had no better ideas
By the time I realized something was wrong it was too late
I went to a private college and my years worth of credits probably would transfer well
Basically I studied to be a teacher and did everything except finish a private school student teaching
I completed the public school one
But since I dropped out of that I have no teaching license so all I can be is a Teacher Aid which is fine by me but the pay is so low compared to what college costs
My parents did encourage me either way
They did say it was okay to not go to college they did either I wish I had waited until I knew what I wanted to do And truthfully I now and I still do know
I been a SAHM for years
I hope to get a job as an Aid at the school by year old will be attending but even then I do know for sure I love it
As a side note I angry I went to college because that meant my now husband would get to
I did know this until years after but he did go because I did and he knew we could afford us both going to college
He wanted to be an engineer
He was going to try the military route to help pay but they would accept him and would tell him why
It feels like I ruined our lives

I m listening to the audiobook version of The Stand because it overlaps with reality pandemic but the plot gives me a comforting sense of order that I find lacking in real life right now

Drama happened between the friend group and i realized how much of a cunt i was
Im now planning on asking her out in the morning so our relationship went from me bullying her to friends to good friends to hopefully dating
Good point was craving something but I wo take the risk
Props to you for putting this out there man but I definitely going to tease a friend by sending this to him and asking if it was him

Anchor man Steve Carell
Did he do something else or is this from a few years ago
That s hard Fallout the story and things to do
And GTA attention to detail and content
Oh
This is fantastic
Now you want me to have
I do pull that crap on you do I
Took me a while to figure out the messed up psychology behind it but I think it has to do with viewing women as conquests rather than just other people
If you think women are here for you are things for you to have then these types of men get confused then angry about women showing their own sexual agency by going and having more sex with other people
If you truly believe you re sexually entitled to women you re not emotionally or mentally equipped to understand women do not belong to you or aren t here solely for you to have
Also I ve noticed over time men do not react well when women act the way they believe only men act
nah it a poverty thing
kids wearing their older sibling clothes
Because I always reply to texts so I don t see why I shouldn t
It lets the person on the other side know that I read their message even if I didn t reply right away
Teens have been using OK boomer to make fun of boomers then older people then people over then people of any age with a boomer mindset then anybody they disagree with at all
It got very confusing

An actual live and hobby
Zoloft works
My sweetheart girl is on that for OCD and it tremendous how it works
There are still moments of obsession but nothing like when she was taking it
All the best to you
Well I was talking about Fortnite wanting money for cosmetics is fine but actively targeting kids
That wrong and kids have STOLEN money to pay and some kids are just fucking spoiled these kids use way too much money I know you retarded honey I know you getting upset it okay you dont understand and its okay just go away shut the fuck up
The person making rash generalizations about the opposite gender or same one for that matter is not very smart
Kind of like calling all whites racist just because some are or just like when people wanted to ban guns because of the shootings even though most civilians with guns follow the law never good to generalize everyone because of a minority or group
Hunt for Red October but keep Sean Connery
Thanks for a positive spin on this situation I needed that
I wish people stopped thinking it was a compliment to tell me how normal I acting
Even if they mean it in a nice way and understand how hard I trying there are lots of people who will go to extreme lengths to put down other Autistics just to try and make me feel better
I think when people see me and compliment me for being normal despite my Autism they do realize that what they doing is revealing their biases about other people and then giving me an exception for being one of the good ones
Hell I I did have to act like this in public
People will give me a hard time at the drop of a hat if I slip up but that the way it goes
Not everyone understands that just being empathetic and having the spine not to give a damn if that one girl is being weird could change the world for people like me
At home my partner lets me eat things weird or spin around the house or bonk him on the head like times and he does think I insane when I have a meltdown even when it scary and sad for both of us
Even my mother was happy when I failed to mask most of my life but after my partner moved in he started being more accepting and she followed suit
Nowadays I watch television shows from different historical time periods to give myself ideas for how to act in public
It works moderately well especially because by blending normal quirks that are just out of date nothing I do strikes people as unsettling so much as it seems out of place
But when I calm in familiar scenarios and can mask almost seamlessly most people see the stereotypes about Autistic people as an insult and so quickly try to reassure me that I could possibly be who I am
They demean people who ca hide so easily and I think that wrong especially because that who I really am on the inside too

Upgrade my house in Animal Crossing
Got up to go to the bathroom peed into a drawer
Basically anyone who ca keep their mouth shut
And to an extent anyone who puts every little thing on social media but that depends on the person
Like if you not homophobic or whatever then great good for you but I have a problem with other people knowing before I was ready to tell them or just other people knowing without me knowing they know
Having someone just casually say something about it and coming to the realization that someone else told them is like a really fucking stressful next couple of minutes

I absolutely loved watching adventure time when I first discovered it until I found out my cheating boyfriend now ex used to watch it with the other girl
The show no longer brings be joy just memories of all the lies he used to tell me
None that have already been enacted
You need to either be the first or the best
If you think you can be the best go find a model that already works really well and do it better than the current best
That really all there is to it
For the same reason PCU and keep Gutter
It is truely spectacular
I might have to edit it again though I there are a million and one spelling mistakes

Edward Scissorhands
Johnny Depp was pretty enough to fit this Labyrinth reference
Would even push the outsider theme even deeper
I agree
Feel free to let it all out
I kinda the person that a lot of people turn to so sometimes I got ta take a break from listening and supporting in order to recharge
But I noticed that some of my guy friends do seem to feel comfortable sharing with others so I want to make sure they can talk to me when they need
I think it important to not bottle it up forever as I know it can make everything more difficult
If you do let it out it kinda explode uncontrollably so it generally better if you can share it before it gets to that point
This is why I do do social media
Im a guy and i also agree
Harry Potter
Everyones a muppet except Luna Lovegood

Saving Private Ryan keeping Adam Goldberg
Bram Stokers Dracula keep Keanu
Just do shave them off and draw in new ones

I trying to educate you because you clearly retarded on this subject
I take it you never had any lesbian friend that actually liked to be around you
You missed all the points it seems
Maybe avoid generalizing an entire subculture of america and assuming they all think exactly the same
Again most of the time with lesbians it really has nothing to do with them hating dick
They born they like women
That how it is for them
Some women go lesbian after being sexually or physically abused
They feel safer with a women
Some women are just ugly and men dont want them so they date each other
Before you judge men do this too
There are million reasons why someone is a lesbian almost always specifically based on their own unique life experiences
Sex doesnt require a dick
Or a dick shaped toy
Many sex toys feel better than dicks
Dicks dont vibrate at high speed

All the hard work is done
Nicotine leaves your body after months you should be getting your sense of smell and taste back to a better level along with no more blocked nose and lots of benifits
The big issue now is habit so things you used to doing that involve smoking
Along with your stress outlet it important to plan for how to handle these now I recommend chewing gum to help through the habit things but you will find one that works for you
The stress one is a big one
Most smokers enjoy just sitting for a bit and thinking as their stress relief if that you trial meditation or breathing exercises something physical that lets your mind decompress for a bit
I still on the smokes but total respect for getting off them
If you have seen the two newer Jumanji movies I highly suggest them
I went to see the first without hope of it being good but the kids wanted to see it
It been a very long time since I laughed that hard
The sequel is great but not quite as good as the first
Samantha An American Girl Holiday
I still terrified of sewing machines after seeing it years ago
I used to sit down under the bar at a restaurant that my mam bought my friend and I to
We used to pick off the gum from under the bar and eat it
I honestly dont know how I still alive
Talking to my girlfriend
She has prevented me from having an anxiety attack before
I have been celibate for years and counting
I was in toxic unhealthy relationships in the past and vowed that I would be single and learn to be okay on my own
It s a little embarrassing sometimes to think I haven t been intimate with someone in so long
But I m damn proud of myself

fucking this i met a girl online who was a literal to me nice body cute tan thick as fuck pear body frame and had a cute face
we text each other and things start to get heavy and we send each other nudes and make a time to meet up to fuck
only one problem she wanted me to cum in her she did not want me to use a condom
at first it was id rather you not use a condom but as we continued to text it became more of im not fucking you unless you cum in me
i almost kinda did it too because i was very sick of not being with someone at the time and the deal she told me sounded pretty good she said she wouldnt tell anyone and would raise the kid without anyone knowing till i was ready to come into their lives
i mean looking back she was extremely baby crazy she worked at a day care and would put snaps of babys saying things like i want this she even told me she hadnt had sex in like a few months to a year and the last time was with someone else who had gotten her pregnant though she unfortunately lost the baby like im in literal awe in how much baby fever she had
even when i tried to reason with her saying yeah id put a baby in you just not when were both but when were in our because i was more than willing to have a long term relationship with her just without going into something we both arent ready for yet but nah get me pregnant

I m glad to hear you re doing well
I was struck by the fact that you served a long sentence and here you are still relatively young
It s good you have family and friends to help you

I follow your thought process because I been there in the same conversation with a friend months ago
Schindler List
YES
BEST CHOICE
But the only should always be the Jewish accountant
Envision the final scene where Oscar Schilder is sobbing about how many lives he could have saved by selling his watch
His ring
Just imagine that emotion come from a muppet who can overact and be too extra
Meanwhile the accountant
He was the most calm and cool character in this whole dark story
It is just one of my favorite ideas I ever come up with on this topic
My friend chad fell asleep on my couch and pissed himself
He is a rather large man so the pee spot was fairly epic
Brazilian wandering spiders
I heard they are super fucking aggressive
I had onenear deth experience it was at i took our car for a drive while everyone at home was sleeping
I was just back then and was a big troublemaker
I loved speeding especially on big roads
I was going that morning then a truck suddenly appeared at the intersection
Thankfully i was able to gear down and break at the same time
My last words would been do tell my parents i took the car out for a drive them scolding me would have been more painful than dying

Made a lot of mistakes made a lot of enemies this is where I ended up
John Wick with Keanu killing Muppets
fresh pasta brownies roast chicken pull apart rolls simple things that if you take the extra time cause who doesnt have that these days and care can go from good to amazing
Pulp fiction but the only human in it is the guy who gets shot at the start
This is a issue of hygiene and preventing infection
If it just sitting there there is a high chance of developing a UTI urinary tract infection
Also it helps to prevent cleaning everything later you probably never left semen on a surface long enough to notice
But it goes through stages once it leaves the body
First it the sticky wet stuff then it becomes thicker and sticker then it becomes super liquid and runs like water
So if you leaving it in it coming out later and will make a mess
Find yourself a hobby you can be passionate about and immerse yourself in it

It took years of becoming comfortable enough with one another and trusting the other will try hard to be reasonable rational and fair to really lay things out
Now that we can do that things never get to the point of ignition
Honesty

It a question of focus
Do you focus on the second sentence in the statement or the first
If it the first I think there actually is a great deal of reason to worry because the second sentence is irrelevant to the living
This happened at my high school after they got a new band director
A few kids quit outright but most of us gave the new guy the benefit of the doubt still ended up quitting bc he murdered our passion

years later that parent will not talk to me

I ve prevented two people from killing themselves
Multiple times for the same person when I was and once recently for my best friend
I m scared that one day I won t be able to save someone though
Infinity Ward made a hectic Shipment only playlist in Modern Warfare and I loved every second of it
Team Sonic Racing especially Clockwork Pyramid
Either that or Haunted Castle
Whats durian
And triple stupid when you miss that bus and then have to slow to a stop
Naturally
I should have asked why is anyone realizing that Variety is just bullying him after he did nothing wrong
So many people like Weinstein deserved prison but the people such as the woman who derailed Louis CK career because she was riding the MeToo bus get to live their lives with impunity despite accusations with no proof
This year
Send more love to you
Yes
I remember the first time I saw the video
My father and my aunt were seeing the video in the desktop PC
I would have like or
I love Pink Floyd but that scene not just scared me
It shocked me that was too much for my me of years old haha
Did you go to school in Richmond CA
My dad has a story similar to this
Mine is Dragon Dogma Dark Arisen Everything
I m class I would always stack the chairs by color
No one cared but I knew it was me who did it every day and it made me proud
Yours is the first I seen that is I right your wrong
Admitting you wrong is so tough to do but this is so funny
A bus pass
School young age parents and money
Is it just me or does the ability to wipe your ass for years not seem incredibly comforting
Breaking Bad
I binge it every year
Well when she started doing it I was like that s weird for a straight person to say
Then we went to carowinds with some friends and she did it heavily and on the ride home I was like dude I like you and u seem like you like me too
But she was like I do but I m straight and I was like tf
Then a few times after that she kept on and I was like okay I ve told her to stop and she s not so the only way out was to stop her
They did
But they were a prostitute I had paid to say that
So I took it with a grain of salt
Annie Hall

Wildly colorful johdpurs
Are you insane
Have you seen the young pope
He looks better than he ever has
Placed in an online multiplayer simulation the player upgrades both vehicles and modules while progressing down any of the many tech trees available
Although this game has a definite feel as opposed to a similar title said game has its fair share of toxicity and premium content
that makes sense
I had no time to form a comprehensive sentence it was more of a series of primal grunts
My house
scaretheater or nexpo
Because bank As well as store cameras etc are recording and storing video hours a day
The amusement cameras are only recording and briefly storing the pictures and then deleting them
Attempting to record and store HD quality video requires A LOT of storage space
Which is why most choose to use lower resolution cameras instead as they will be able to store weeks of video for little storage space
Whereas recording HD video could only store a couple days at most
Evil dead Ash Williams is the only human
Antibiotics make it not so bad

We get to the car and I kiss her
I look down at the car and I see some movement
I look closer and it s her kids
She had left both her kids in the car for four hours while we were on this date
These kids must have been like
I asked her if someone was with her kids on our date she said no they were old enough to take care of themselves
I was like wtttffffffff
Told her I had to go
Texted her a few days later telling her it wasn t cool she left her kids in the car alone until pm by themselves
Also ended up filing a report to CPS for other things I noticed

https Keep Your Distance Richard Thompson
I absolutely hate them
But you can try using menthol cough drops during them
That helps me
It cools down your throat and nasal passages and alleviates that choking feeling so many of us get with attacks
Indiana Jones The Last Crusade keep Sean Connery
I really don t hate this scene
She liked you enough to introduce you to her friend felt comfortable enough with you to wear slippers and it sounds like you didn t have to pay for anything or drive
Def not the worst story on here
If they were rolling jazz cigarettes I think I would have stayed Different strokes for different folks I guess
https Currently my latest fave
It s poor communication on her part for sure but maybe you didn t continue the conversation beyond that when she thought you were settling in for a chat
But like if someone s barely communicating then berating you on a regular basis you need to sit them down and explain that this isn t going to work long term unless something changes

I do wonder what they do with the information they receive
Okay stick with me here
Things are going to get a little bit crazy
I making love with bigfoot
Suddenly a gunshot rings out
Bigfoot slumps to the ground and his limp toes slide out of my mouth
I want to scream with every fiber of my being but I ca
I must not
I stand up and start running
Bullets whiz by me as I run faster than I ever ran before but I ca stop running
I run harder than my induced
I run until my lungs are on fire and the fire rises higher
I make it out of the forest and take refuge in the nearby town of Borger Texas
I check into a sleazy motel on the outskirts of town under a fake name
Shaking with nervous adrenaline I stumble into the bathroom ready to puke until the cows come home
Something does feel right
I thought those noises were my heart but that illusion was shattered in a crash as the door was blown off its hinges by a kick that could open a bank vault
In an instant I recognized her face
It was Diane McCluskey Bigfoot lawfully wedded wife
Knowing there was only one way out I whipped out my pocket nunchucks
NYOOM I swirled and twirled and fought with reckless abandon but I was no match for old Matrimonial McCluskey
Beaten and disarmed I pleaded with the Cluskster for my sorry pitiful life
My last thoughts were silenced with a sweeping slash of her katana
Did know there are so much films with the same details
I meant Braveheart
Not if I get a hold of you

His lyrics are also motivational and articulate instead of I pop a bean yuh

i had a friend who smoked heroin for a year or two but when i caught up with him after he got cleaned he said it was one of the worst feelings of his life
it was sweaty for days and had body aches all over during his withdrawal

so yeah don t do heroin

Yes these things are possible when the population isn t high
Try scaling that philosophy up to a city Seattle s size
It s a lot harder to drive that level of commitment and resident consensus to pump money into something like helping the homeless to the degree you d like to see
Otherwise we would ve seen a similar city do so by now

Can you really tell me that you can think of any small creature that would be terrifying as human sized
People are terrified of insects as it is
Rodents are vicious little bastards
Everything else are dicks and will bite or scratch if provoked

Can you imagine human sized frogs jumping around and swimming in the same waters that you swim in

I lost my leg in Vietnam but nobody would know any different
Ejaculated into my girlfriend colostomy stoma
She was paralyzed from the chest down from a spinal cord injury when she was a kid
She used an indwelling catheter and had a colostomy
We had been intimate for awhile and I was used to her body
We usually stuck with oral and handjobs but sometimes had vaginal sex
One night she was freshly bathed and lying in bed and I was pounding away at her pussy when she told me to pull out and cum in her stoma
It was a little awkward positioning myself I had to kind of straddle one leg but I stuck the tip of my cock inside her a little and jerked until I came
Interesting experience for both of us not really a big deal
I usually pulled out and unloaded on her belly and my cum had gotten on her stoma before so it was too shocking to do just something to try
The Hobbit where only Ian McKellen is human
I do care about the movie I just care about that time where he stormed off set

Please Use your time for good and Finish what you have started
Study hard
Best of luck
John Wick obviously keep Keanu Reeves but could you imagine the carnage of flying fluff as he blasts his way through russian mob muppets
That right there is where it fucking gets you
It convinces you that reaching out is hopeless
And you so sensitive that if the response is worded wrong or said in the wrong tone you will absorb it as full rejection and you wo try again

Journalists
They the types of people who risk their lives to make a change to their nation even if it means having to expose those who are more powerful than they are
Despite acknowledging the consequences of their reckless behavior they would continue to step first into problems in which they have no business tinkering with
Most of them especially in countries with unfair government systems are punished for trying to make a change for the better
Solute to them for having the courage to fight for what they believe in even if it means having to sacrifice everything
They on the lookout for the balloon army

I can share the reason that she was stalking me the exact reason she stabbed me i do not remember however
It was the final year of secondary school we had been in the top set for maths from the very beginning and she was always at the top of the class for every single practice exam as she took he education very seriously and was under a lot of pressure from family and I was always despite never paying attention in lessons or doing any work outside of answering questions on the board and the actual practice exams
She became increasingly obsessed with me as her family life became harder and she was put under increasing amounts of pressure to succeed and I was just naturally good so one thing led to another and she started stalking me until I moved away a few weeks after she stabbed me the police never got involved and the stab wound was serious so i just bandaged it up and let it heal naturally

I don t think that there s anything wrong people who don t want to be in relationships or have relationships though

yea thats why im not religious myself not atheist either just kinda meh on the whole thing
I get hung up on religious things as well as its full of contradictions or too convenient vauge answers that never helped me is why i left years ago
I find it more interesting of why people believe in certain religions like one minute they say gay people will burn in hell but next minute high up priests are caught covering up lower priest child fondlers within their own dead silence from them
Its amazing how much things do seem to fit together in this world in odd regulation but there is also alot of turmoil and hardship to people who mean no harm
SO i choose to ignore all the religious shit and be a good person because i do like to help others when they are in need and someday when i need the help there are others like me to help without the fear of something looming over me

Not only is it an awesome game and I adore playing it on the rare occasion that I do play it but because it was the first video game I ever played
Most of the Call of Duty games for the late
People were partial to the futuristic gameplay and style of games such as Infinite Warfare and Black Ops which was pretty boring with it missing a story campaign and the developers' bad attempts to fix it through the release of a World War II game
I once noticed something outside at night when I was about or years old
Weird shadows and what not
I pushed back the curtain and found myself face to face with an unknown man who backed away from the window slowly returned to his car and casually drove away
VR even the best ones aren t that great yet
I feel like a lot of the old school slasher flicks would really work out nowadays because most people are strapped and with the shits

Build a nice computer
Always been into computers and went back to school in late and got a diploma in a sysadmin type field
The reason why I dropped out of college after high school took so long to go back and have been able to work in the past year after graduating is I was a heavy polysubstance addict for years
I finally got some help last year and have been doing well in terms of not using but my passion for computers has been affected by feeling depressed and also by having an older shitty computer since my money was spent on drugs in the past
I know if I had a nice computer I could take some courses to prepare for certifications and spend more time messing around learning Kali linux and other fun stuff that I used to like doing
I spend most of my time in recovery groups and meetings or feeling shitty at home but its a lot better then how I was when I was using

He witnessed his squad mate get blown up by a land mine and took shrapnel in his chest from it
He was with the of survivors from that side of the war
He earned two Purple Hearts for those who were keeping count
And he founded a college
The main building of that college shares my last name and it has an eight foot tall mural of his portrait in the atrium
For me he set the standard of what a man should strive to be which I fail to live up to on a daily basis

I was actually reallt sad about this one
But when I was just entering high school i had this mentally unstable friend who used to put her shit on me
I loved her but ir was such an unhealthy friendship
She used to pit other people against me all the time while maintaining a fixation on me
She also cut herself every which way everywhere
Which I was trying to really deal with
But she put it on me
Not because of me
But she make me swear not to tell anyone and stuff and at a young age it put me in an awful position
Of course i told my mom
Anyways she even do things like write herseld a note that was drom her ex only she wrote it
So she pretend to be her ex
Then shed cut herself with a razor blade and put it bloody in the bote pretending her ex did it and sent it to her
What was I supposed to do with that
And she would just constantly pit friends against me
So i had to tell her
I love you
But i ca be your friend anymore
She was my friend because of friendship
She was my friend because i was easy to use for her unhealthy fixations
Not because she was lonely
If she was lonely she would have mistreated me
It was fsr beyond what I could handle
Constantly being put in compromising and dramatic situations by her so she could come to my rescue so then she easily be able to manipulate me further hust to fuel herself
I hsd to let her go because i loved her
Anyways she damn good now

Oh goodness instant coffee is terrible
I started doing cold brew months ago when my coffee pot broke and now I never go back
It less bitter than when you brew it hot added bonus I use less stuff to sweeten it
I took a liter glass jar learned it equaled about cups of coffee and used about tsp of grounds per cup so between tsp depending on how strong I want it
Fill with water shake and put in my fridge for hours
Strain out a cup in the morning I use cheesecloth through a little strainer first and then a little Keurig filter cup into a jar to get the finer particles
Add a little creamer and good to go
You can heat it for hot coffee too
Stovetop is another option do have to wait hours that way
Simmer some water with grounds do boil and then pass through a filter of your choice when it looks to be strong enough for you
Or you can get filters put grounds in them and then tie them up with string like little coffee tea bags so you do have to filter it afterwards
I prefer cold brew method to stovetop personally
It takes a little time and effort but my god you have to suffer through instant coffee

I am so incredibly sorry
It s not fair
I understand the feeling of shock upon realizing that we aren t invincible it doesn t make sense because you think this wouldn t happen to the main character in a story this wouldn t happen to me or my loved ones
I am so sorry to hear that it is happening to your friends
A good friend of mine died of a aneurism in his sleep the feeling of being shortchanged seeing someone you love so much life end too soon is so incredibly hard try not to face this alone if you re comfortable talking about this with your parents please do or with your other best friend but trying to grieve alone is an impossible task
You and you re friends sound lovely especially bc of that mama Mia reference

I m so sorry why can t you cry in front of your parents
Sounds like they don t even listen to you and try to hear you explain why you are upset
Sometimes our family does not know how to show love the way we may need them to
It doesn t mean they don t love you but you do need to learn how to live yourself
Especially when your immediate family doesn t make you feel good about yourself
Do you have any friends who understand and can help you when you feel this way
I ve always said you can t choose family
But you can choose your friends
I really hope you can find some good people to help support you and you can help support them
In the meantime I hope you can get some comfort from things like reddit or anonymous social media
Is there any way you can talk to an online therapist
I don t know if there are free ones available but it might be worth it to research
That may help with anxiety or even a doctor if you re able to talk to one via video chat and potentially get prescribed medication if you are interested
Mentally its important to try and work hard at your emotional and mental health
Sometimes even exercise helps too to give you endorphins and energy and an activity
A hobby such as crafts reading writing learning a language etc could take your mind off things
Or even binge watching fun shows on Netflix or watching fun comedies etc
Try to stay positive
I think the healthier you are mentally emotionally and physically you will hopefully attract people who have similar values and keep those people around you good luck

So we send this guy through classroom stuff he bitching the whole time that he should just get his racing license and that this is a waste of time
Well the following day is your first taste of seat time where you SUPPOSED to drive at like of what you think you can do and really focus on getting the drive line correct and more importantly have awareness of whats around you
Well this guy goes FLYING out of the pits and gets up to around mph going into turn one
Guy was going WAY too fast for his car
if he had a a true performance car he might have made the turn but he had a heavy ass street car with regular tires on the car and he completely blew the turn went through a chain link fence about yards off the track
before bottoming out into a ditch where the car was obviously totaled
the car was towed to the paddock but it was going to take the guy a couple days to make arrangements with his insurance company to have it officially totaled
during those couple days im not sure how it started heppening
but people engraved HUNDREDS of penises into the paint on his car
now mind you all the body panels were heavily damaged they werent ruining anything that was already ruined

Not so young anymore but it was super nice while I had it going on
Girls would willingly talk to me and I generally had a smoother time in all human interactions even though I was and still am pretty introverted
Couple years ago I just moved into a new flat with a couple mates
Brand new house
Nicely finished
We were able to rent it for cheap because it belonged to one of the flatmates stepdads
I Had been talking with this girl for a few days and we seemed to be clicking had similar lifestyles similar interests
She looked very attractive in her photos
You see where this is going
Anyway along with my flatmates I was hosting a flat warming party so we invited a whole load if people out
It was a rural property so not many neighbours around to annoy it ended up being a big thing
She hits me up and asks what I upto I tell her she asks If she can come
Me thinking I gon na get laid and have a great party I say yeah why not
She asks if she can bring some girlfriend my mates are like yeah we need more girls
A few hours later and a couple cars I dont recognize are coming up the driveway
It her and her friends
Two fricking car loads of them
She jumps out and I dont recognise her
Turns out she a photoshop wizard like she not ugly but certainly not the same person in the photos
Cue awkward moment
Then her girlfriend jump out and they not exactly girls my mates are cracking up at me
Cue awkward moment
At this point I drunk enough that I thinking a root is a root and I going to hell anyway so why not
I start mixing some tunes and she popping the selfies and the hashtags like I some famous DJ and throwing herself at me
It was kind if overwhelming and then she like can we go to your room
You can fill in the blanks here
Morning comes
She still here
All here friends have apparently gapped and so she now stranded at my house
I get out of bed grab some food assess how much of a mission cleaning is going to be and come back to the room to find her measuring the floor space with a tape measure
Oh this will work fine for my daughters crib
Cue awkward moment
I try to be polite and not say anything about it as I offer to drive her home so that this nightmare encounter can end
Never had a more awkward minutes as she telling me about how it would be a perfect space for us and that she loves the idea of her kid growing up so close to the Bush etc etc
We stop outside her place and she like I just be a minute I have to feed my girl and get her some clothes and then we can go back to yours
As soon as she closed the door I hot footed it out of there and unmatched
Aight no trouble for sure for sure
Looking for a place to hide your weed huh

I was in a dream riding my bike around our estate at night when I ran into a dark figure standing in the middle of the path staring directly at me terrified I woke up only to be lying in my bed frozen and staring directly at the same figure who was at the end of my bed still gazing at me I tried to scream fuck off and move my fingers but I was frozen still for about a minute in pure fear until I finally gain consciousness and snapped out of it
I never slept on my back or without my eyes covered ever again after that
Once got high in Colorado and thought I was going to die so I tried to call my parents and tell them I love them but I was too high to roll over and get my phone
A lot else happened but that s the gist lol

I always get weird looks when I ask for marinara sauce with chicken tenders
I do get why that so weird
It s actually really good for specialized medicine
The US has the most cutting edge stuff that while expensive has better outcomes than the rest of the world
The problem is our system of primary care is not so good in terms of cost efficiency
That coupled with the fact that Americans have a lot of diabetes heart disease and obesity makes the situation not great
Whoa

When you go on a rollercoaster the camera has a higher shutter speed and is typically only a DSLR
When you have a shutter speed high enough you need to compensate for the lack of light by using a flash you can usually see it when riding a coaster
At a bank etc
they have video cameras without flash
You can t get the same resolution or speed as the DSLR

Teleportation
People usually downplay it but it s really good
A friend and I once had a discussion for two haut about which is the best superpower and came to this conclusion
I mean you can escape in any kind of situations and fight people won t ever see you coming and you could use it on your daily life
You want to to sleep an extra ten minutes
No problem
Bc with teleportation you don t have to worry about getting to work or getting to school on time

Originally it was Mewtwo with an appreciation for Charizard since I grew up watching gen
But for the last or so years it has been Garchomp
I always admired the initial mystery behind the dragon type and in every game they gave me the most thrilling challenge to catch
Garchomp is just a notch above the rest like flying at mach speeds always catching its prey and that beautiful penance stare
I getting goosebumps right now but perhaps I biased since Cynthia use of hers sold me on Garchomp
Whether it gym leader champion or trainer you best believe there a badass with every intention of ripping your team apart and sending your candy ass back to that bedroom that you woke from your coma in when you had the not so bright idea to go on this journey and challenge me The Rock
As you can see I like Garchomp
Yeah it pretty fucked up
Eventually pretty sure I will need to get professional help

In which ways do the president and Senate not care about the people
If this is related to covid by all means what would your approach be to handling this virus
Its funny how people blame Trump for everything when there are so many people behind the scenes working around the clock and proposing ideas to him
He has say but he does know everything
No one can know every single thing about a variety of subjects
It impossible
This is why he has people who he trusts working on the current situation
Fauci has been around since the well respected
But even during these times he may not always have the best solutions or he and Trump and other govt officials may bump heads on what steps to take
It an emergency situation
One not seen in recent history
You can only predict so much
Public health officials are working with what they have
Trump has placed many orders for necessary equipment but he ca rush the process faster then it going
Creating and distributing can only be done so quickly
There are so many elements at play that make the coming together difficult
People will stumble and make mistakes the important thing is we corrected these mistakes and we are trying to do the best we can
Instead of hating or being so negative I do understand why people ca be supportive and understanding when this leader is showing that he is doing the best he can with what he and our country have to work with
Not to mention the globe has stopped spinning just because popped up
Our president and govt still have to carry out their regular duties
And right now as we are fighting this invisible war we are at a greater risk of attack by other countries
There is a lot going on at the moment
I really like to see all the people who constantly criticize Trump do the job he doing
It a difficult position to fill
So when you say they do care please clarify what you mean
From everything that I seen and read factual not fake biased BS we are doing the best we can
And yes I say we because it is we the people
When they say we are in this together we are
And right now is not the time for Trump hate or BS this is serious
We should be united not unjustly criticizing our govt and president
And by saying the US allowed this your saying why did you I and others allow this
We are the US
And whether you like it or not the majority of people in this country voted for Trump and Republican majority rule for the Senate
Instead of criticizing our leader and the Senate try doing something to better other people lives at this time if you feel that they have done a poor job of it

Our senior prank was fun with how much it fucked with the school cause it got to the point where the cops got called on us
Our first one started with our Fighting Ring' that we made sure the entire school knew about but never announced just started it as a rumor and let it get passed along
It would be going on at lunch every day in a secluded area in the forest next to the school but close enough so we could all still make it back to class in time
We were taking bets for all of the fights but what the school did know is that all of the money we were making from it was getting donated to the football team cause we had a great team but our gear was complete garbage
If I remembering correctly I think in total we raised like in a week
Something along those lines while it aint much anything helps
Now eventually the principal found out and she was furious and once we found out she knew we started changing it up for where and when we were doing it

On the Baltic Sea side so the weather was very mild and pleasant
It was magical I would go to the beach and sit by the ocean for hours

Look at naughty Russian fortnut memes
My mil did like me for years
Then two years ago I cut ties with my abusive parents and she realized I was the person my family made me out to be
Yesterday she called to check on me
I am homeschooling our girls and my husband works from home
She told me she was proud of me and I was doing a great job
After I hung up I cried happy tears
She would say that unless she really meant it
My parents are narcissists so they were only proud of me because my accomplishments were extensions of them and therefore their accomplishments
It felt good
Today I was DMing a long raid through the streets of Boston which are forever in flux due to the constant fluctuation of unstable ley lines and a mad reality bending wizard and the druid had summoned a pack of dire wolves who were following her and mauling Elven mages left and right but she took an arrow in the chest and broke concentration ending her conjured wolves
She then spent turns beating the shit out of that archer with her shillelagh and three nat in a row

Knowing full well that dealerships make a lot of money in the finance office after the price has been agreed to does it make sense for a customer to make the salesman or sales manager think that may end up purchasing stuff on the back end extended warranty BS protection GAP etc in order to get a better sales price on the car
I confused on what you are saying here
It is the Pentagon
Do you really think they are going to release any footage to the world that is not a far lower resolution lower detail and lower everything than they keep for themselves
Also do you not think they have multiple systems in place like thermal cameras that they could use to figure stuff out
OR
You are trying to say banks purposely release lower quality because they have a better system in general than they let on to the public

Cries of bias are pointless
Information is not biased
People reportage of that information is
That reportage has to be colored by our experiences it is unavoidable
It not a negative thing either so long as we do try to obscure truth in the process
And the truth is even if you subscribe to religious beliefs you certainly do subscribe to belief systems or even everything you been told about your own belief system
So clearly you too have to accept' is just a name extant belief systems have imposed on extinct ones
If your belief system went extinct the same thing would happen
That you believe it somehow special should obscure the truth that extinct cults were just as special to their adherents
Truth does have to lie in between two points of view
This is a logical fallacy called the fallacy of the middle https

Hyper self awareness sucks
You realize you have to change the way you act knowing exactly your strengthes and weaknesses and work on
You realize the choices you made in your past not consciously but subconsciously since the subconscios acts independently like your automatic responses to certain situations It requires a lot of work and reminders and while you fighting against it it hurts like a bitch and reinforces self negative talk sometimes
I swear to god so many people on this planet do even know themselves very well and going with the flow
But I also know that if you want to live your life at full potential it worth to fight and not give up even though the process is painful

I was takin a pee in a urinal at a Bulls basketball game at the United Center
I had such a full bladder and was feeling the pain
A kindly old man gave let me cut in front of him to get to the urinal and when I did my head was in a daze
I closed my eyes as I usually did but as I opened them I saw what appeared to be the holy mother virgin de guadelupe recognized her from a candle I bought a week earlier with the stains on the back of the urinal
I did flush and told that old man that a miracle had happened and he dropped down right there in the bathroom knee touching a questionable wet spot and started taking his clothes off
He appeared unbothered by it but knelt in prayer and touched my mustache and thanked me for revealing the holy mother
We were both hispanic so the bond was obvious but we had to make sure no other gringos pissed away the holy mother and physically blocked the urinal from being used the rest of the game
Some gentleman were pretty mad but you do argue with a one naked man and a physically imposing tall man such as myself
I never doubted God again after that
I took pictures and a sample of the urinal water in my cup to keep next to my bed that I pray to each night

Beetlejuice People are thinking funny but what about the mentality of the characters
Keep Lydia as the human and the rest are muppets
I honestly think it would be adding a layer to the loss of her mother making her appear insane and deranged
Hallucinating her father and are real it would another reason to the Maitlands being able to do all the ghost things they do and the ending scene with her floating
And the scenes without Lydia would be hilarious imagine seeing some muppets screaming at a sandworm or driving off a bridge hell even the scene

It s the first home I ve ever felt attached to in my entire life long story
Dh hates our house though
He says it s not fair for of our kids to have to share a bedroom
He thinks all kids should have their own rooms talk about world problems
Well then why tf did he go along with buying this house
He wants to alter ruin because there s no way to do it that wouldn t ruin it the house to force a room out of it
I don t want to
Oh and he never wants to move again so Now I hate my house
I constantly feel tension in it knowing that dh wants to butcher it
I resent him for wanting a room and he resents me for not wanting one

Nothing
Pushed through the internship and my classes as best I could
Cried the second night because the constant pain wasn t letting me get any rest
Wound up asking my dad to take me in to urgent care around because I d go crazy trying to last another day without help
Doc gave me a steroid shot and told me to take it easy
I don t know if the shot actually worked since I still didn t get any relief for another
Even then that spot was still twingey for the next month and is still sensitive years later
What caused it
Who knows
I wasn t any more stressed out then than I was at any other point
I hadn t been lifting anything or sitting differently than normal
It felt like a giant fuck you from the universe for no reason
I would say GT Sport or
But ca use the playstation for the simple reason my brother is on it for hours straight
Then it sleep time and I ca use it
You see it in my mum room because of said brother yelling at his friends during the news or whatever
So it put in mum room so my parents ca hear him
I really regret spending my to go halves in it with him
I really wish I bought an xbox
Then I could actually have a console I can use

It looks like the population of Punxsutawney in the census was people
However the festivities normally attract an average of people in https So let say they had the exact average in Groundhog Day along with the exact population of the census
So there were people on that day
Let just say Phil spent years or days in Groundhog Day that would require people to turn into Muppets every single day
For years days it would be people Muppeted per day

Not sure if it changes on location but nodding where I from so my knowledge base is always a greeting or acknowledging you seen someone
You nod down to strangers or people your not close to and nod up to people that are close to you

My parents blessed me with a beautiful name due to my father s last name and with my looks that think are good I do get girls but I don t think anyone understands the pain of having this name that nobody gets until you tell them it sounds like Hung low like if I had a large penis that hangs It s a pain that nobody understands

Two conditions that only ever exist on paper
I want to speak in the most respectful professional manner possible please bare with me
You again prove the point of not blatantly calling out short men to be more unattractive
I can quote you on this that prefer tall
Ergo you have a distaste for
If I prefer and I was given a choice for either or
I going to choose I would not want because it not I therefore have a distaste for because it not
Now please tell me how can you not think short men are ugly
I not trying to sarcastic I really want to get to the bottom of this because it completely boggles my mind that the universality of denial is so prevalent
Thanks
Raping today year olds
Fight Club Well keep his ego as a character
Damn the movie would ve been even better this way

honestly it a wonderful game with endless possibilities if you have creativity
people read books for fun too

Aw
Death by
That is the saddest of all stories
Ca even imagine the blow on ego this would give me
I never swipe on girls more than a level over my league
It worse than matching with someone uglier than you because the conversation rarely goes anywhere
In your case the inital conversation was great but of course it still came crashing down
Seven
Keep Morgan Freeman
Seeing a Muppet yell What in the box
sounds fantastic
Yeeeeeeeess
Me or you
Lmao sorry I actually learning English so it complicated to be understood all the time
I actually going through something quite similar to that
Knowing the pain makes it even worse to hear
I been to a few doctors as well
It wont stop
Ever
OP above all else stay safe and don t do anything stupid
We will all die eventually
We don t even know when maybe you have years left maybe you have
But it s often not something you can control so there s no need to worry yourself thinking about it D I m usually around if you ever need a stranger on the internet to talk too
I know you said it s nothing suicidal but the offer stands all the same
Rocky
Definitely keep Ivan Drago Dolph Lundgren
It would be hilarious
explore space
Far from Home keeping Tom Holland Imagine the giant elemental muppets
Take your time you only get to experience it for the first time once
And do your utmost to avoid spoilers
Speed but keep Sandra Bullock sorry Keanu
Where in Time is Carmen Sandigo I learnt the most about different cultures that way as well as history but it set up to not let you realise you actually learning
How would we tell that she s not a muppet
Endgame but only keep Chris Evans
Feeling that I was relegated to a field I did enjoy and going nowhere
Now
Worried I going to sabotage my opportunities to actually change field and go somewhere
Though I am doing much better with avoiding self sabotage now hence why I in the current position

My first legendary Pok�mon from my first Pok�mon game
That rainbow chicken will always have a special place in my heart
Seinfeld ran for a long time but it never felt long in the tooth and it had a proper ending instead of milking the latter episodes until the inevitable cancellation
Unlimited sleep
First of all I black
Secondly I agree with you that some people are like that liberal or otherwise
There is an issue in the United States and other countries with stereotypes about people that look like me or at the very least do look like the majority or mostly homogeneous population
Thirdly again people think like that regardless of political views or alignment
To scapegoat that onto modern liberalism purposely ignores America history with the model minority trope
So before you continue to insinuate that I do get it I want to assure you that I do get it
I live it
I assuming that you do get jealous but its a feeling that I rather not have
I find it in a way that shows how much I like a person but other than that it can be a disturbance
Dude this should be an episode of reply all
Seth Green as the only human would also be hilarious
Mythology is accepted by everyone to be fictional
Religion is accepted only by some to be fictional
Personally I think a lot of mythology makes more sense than the three Abrahamic religions
It kindaaa looks like a ballsack hanging below serbia on a map i think it flag is red with a yellow sun in the center
it probably was a part of yugoslavia at one point i do know though that about all i know about the republic of moldova

Vancouver
So a tiny bit of backstory this happened when i was i made a post on an AMA type of thing talked with some people and with a few i continued talking on kik in the comments i left my kik username for one person but they did message me Fast forward a week out of nowhere i get a message on kik not knowing who it from or how they got my username they explained why they msgd me and why they did msg for a week we continued talking found out that she a girl my age and just bored and wanted to talk with ppl so we talked every now and then a few weeks after that we started talking daily started hanging out on discord and skype whenever we got the chance and a year later i found myself on a plane going half way across the continent to spend a week at a house of someone i met on a shitty meme site yeah we ended up in a relationship and yeah it fell apart in a few months but before that i think i can call that the best segment of my life
I really did expect that especially since she did message me the same day but almost a whole week later Funny thing is just around the time i met her i started making more friends in highschool started to get to know the people i was around and i always got kind of awkward when they asked about dating and why i never talk about it it was because i did really know how they react if i said i had a crush on this girl i met online
Later some of them told me that they thought i might be gay bc of how i reacted later everyone cought on to what was actually up since whenever someone asked me who i was talking to on my phone out of boredom my answer was always the same TL DR started chatting with a random person online and it ended up being the best period of my life so far

Last year in my junior year of college I had a hard breakup and decided to use tinder I met this girl and we talked for a week and we decided to meet up we partied and she insisted she come back to my place
She pulled out her phone during sex and recorded us taking pictures of herself me for the whole duration
Fast forward to the next week she s texting me messages before I respond about when we can see each other again
The next weekend my friends come from various school and of course I see her at a party
She runs up to me and grabs my face digging her nails into either cheek demanding that we have sex again while my friends stand there in shock as my face bleeds
I delete tinder block here number and move on
Fast forward to this year I ve been with my girlfriend since right after that weird tinder date and my girlfriend starts getting weird texts
Then all at once s of pictures come in and videos of me and this
OMG THOSE ARE BOMB
For this to work you must look them directly in the eye
Abraham Lincoln and Tyler Durden
All the games on
Exactly
Nihilism is a conceit not a plan
These tectonic plates about in
Because stuff I failed to grasp in HS but nevertheless saw demonstrated IRL by smart peepole
Lost my keys
First off all i have to say that i absolutly love the concept pf open world
Idc if some of them are empty or filled with the same sidequests over and over i love them every single time
So this is kinda hard for me
I think ill go with batman arkham knights one i can already see the hate coming Now it must be said i loved the game but in my eyes the map looks the same literally everywhere
I also like to free roam just exploring and well if you do that in arkham knight people will constantly try to kill you they arent hard to take out but ya know its still annoying
And then there is riddler
Now usually i like the idea of small riddles as side stuff but its just too much
Every single cornor on the map has another riddler challenge
I usually dont care about the collection stuff filling an open world but here its just too much in my eyes
Bruh they scary
Joker and Joaquin Phoenix is the only human
Blair White
Where can you start watching it
Despacito
Days good drugs and days bad drugs
And days times for doin drugs and days times for not doin drugs
And hey brother we gon na do some right now
Cheech Chong
We usually give a few shakes to make sure theres no excess and then put it back in I guess you could use a piece of toilet paper but its usually a waste
Microsoft
Great product line
Surface pro for example makes an excellent tablet for artists it great for planning scheduling runs the desktop version of windows etc
Them updates though man
Seven

It is so much that his comedy is inappropriate as it is about him masturbating in front of people who did consent or ask for a wank show
Cocaine off a hookers ass
That bitch
West Wing
Fucking save money
Even if it a month put money away into an account at a bank that is your regular
Do get a debit card attached
Do get checks for it
Keep it completely separate from any manner of access that is physically going to the bank
Besides the monthly deposit do even look at the balance
That way it takes actual effort to spend that you can easily avoid
I can not stress this enough
Life is going to throw curve balls your way
It is going to
I it
Having money stashed away for true emergencies will save you literal weeks if not months of stress and anxiety
Anything
Cops are all shitheads
Willne for the dub
Or maybe MattHDGamer since I ve been watching a lot of videos where he plays with pro soccer players
If you include tax it will change craxy

Who doesnt know that

The Greatest Showman

My favourite car of all time IRL is the dodge charger pursuit

Why physical affection is so hard for him to give
ever come in from the freezing cold and touched something warm
it kinda like that
After its gone through agricultural training courses
Rip
Living in the future because you wo even have it for long
The present is always eating away at it
Fawful
His timeline of events clearly shows a downward spiral into madness from Superstar Saga showing him as an apprentice Partners In Time having him build his army and once he gets the Dark Star in Bowser s Inside Story you can clearly see him slowly being malformed and changed from the humorous jolly Fawful into an evil vessel for the Star
You wrong
There is no such muscle to close the urethra besides your Kegel muscles
These muscles do not close the urethra on their own
They consciously controlled
This is how you would normally stop a stream of piss erection or not
Additionally it perfectly possible and in fact quite easy to piss while erect
This
LSD and MDMA
I think if everyone had a positive experience with these the world would be way better
I do think they go into space atmosphere is actually quite big
head lice
You do
Oh
Well it was just a joke
John Wick but Keanu Reeves is the only real human and he s killing muppets
Why leave
He s giving you great material and sounds like the type to offer to pay
Worse case you leave in a huff you ve
Pregnant
Tombstone but keep Val Kilmer
Because video games are usually viewed as simply being entertainment while reading books are typically viewed as an intellectual hobby since you re basically doing what you do when you study
The Princess Bride
Keep Andre the Giant
Dihydrogen monoxide
ABCDE
Im sorry to whoever named their child this but that kid is going to grow up with social problems
Dont use your kid to make yourself look quirky
My personal favorite
I make the argument that Die Hard is undoubtedly a Christmas movie but it s also an anytime movie
Like Elf
Definitely Christmas but appropriate all year
Rick
Because he drugged my friend with the intention of raping her when it did work he managed to convince her that I did it
Later she married him
Checkmate atheists
I think the imperials as they decided to save the lives of the people instead of rising to power
Sounds like you left out last night dinner once or twice
The matrix Keanu reeves he is the one
Yeah it did
I in TN we on lockdown lmao
Peter Coffin the landlord of The Spouter Inn in by Herman Melville
One of the greatest comic characters ever written
Well tbf he wasn t going to get through by skill
He was up against the most powerful evil wizard in the world and he s a kid
I live in a pretty nice suburbian community so my stories probably are as wild as others
One time from around PM to AM there was a disheveled man seemingly homeless dressed in only boxers and a torn up stained wifebeater loitering on the sidewalk to the street that is behind my home
He was cursing at the wall that preserved the privacy of the houses' backyards from the sidewalk
Basically he was screaming about how Bernie Sanders would initiate brutal class warfare on rich people
Eventually after a literal hours of his ranting the cops came twice but let him go since he did really do anything bad he tried to rob some woman that was walking by
However he was seemingly drunk and tripped on a crack faceplanting himself into the sidewalk
The cops came minutes later and with the woman literally pointing the finger at him he was arrested
The Exorcist everyone except Regan is a muppet
Oh God
yay
The professional
Keep the fern
Why girls travel in literal packs to washrooms
Hey that sounds pretty resourceful for the situation you re in
I live in the middle of nowhere and under normal circumstances would have no qualms about driving miles for a good meal out but it seems a bit excessive for takeout especially with the whole stay at home stuff
Meme it
again a couple minutes detentions
these schools sound dystopian
Uninstalling Instagram and finding a place to belong
A black cat went past us and then another that looked just like it

I never met him in person lol
Ask someone to retrieve it for me as a birthday present

good one mate
He lived in a different city and I just stopped contacting him and he stopped contacting me
We ran into each other at an event and he was so excited to see me

It was awkward

Jake Peralta would approve
That sounds like your pockets are tiny if you ca fit your own hand in there
I know someone out there probably already made this but I want to know
My two favorite hangouts are strip clubs and casinos
But I doubt I be going back to either any time soon
Even when the lockdown ends even when these business I still be hesitant to be the first one in there on the day they open
I m going to go back to the beach
I m going to sit in the warm sand with my toes buried and just breathe and listen to the waves

Enjoying what u see
I had went to that type of class when I was in grade it s taught us how to prepare for interviews and how to make a resume and the do s and don t of having a job and having a safe work environment
Not tinder but
I ended up talking to a year old girl

Once she confessed her real age I ended all conversation with her
I still kinda feel like a pedophile at times

ikr
Lived with a dude for months
He used my scissors to trim his beard I hope it was a beard when I found them in the bathroom
He destroyed many of dishware
Called me psycho
His girlfriend would text me all the shit he would say about me behind my back
She would threatened me to stay away from her man
He lied constantly
And almost tried to get out of paying for breaking his lease
I had to call him for months to get him to pay up
Any variant of how are you handling this quarantine
I ve been in therapy for a few years I m trying to hold on to as much anger and resentment as I can
I don t think I ll ever let myself forgive her I swore a while ago that I wouldn t risk having kids later on because when I was little I would copy what she would do to me and apply it to stuffed animals
Six or seven year old me would scream at and slap a plush bear then lock it in a room for a few hours
I don t want to to be like her
You finally answered the question
Thank you
That actually does make any sense

I just politely tell them you concerned about them and state that you noticed they been over working and might benefit from just taking a day off to rest
But i leave it at that
At my last job i work hour weeks but i literally stay awake at night thinking of things that need to be done
Sometimes a day off does help unless you ready for it

The BIG SAD
I think you missed some math there
of the pop to be infected then half show symptoms that of the infected then of those need hospitalization that and then half of those of total infected will die if we continue on our current trajectory with no advancement in treatment methods
We are only seeing death rate right now because not all of the world ICU beds and ventilators have been used up yet
Once they used up and we have to turn people away we could easily pass
I dont know
Maybe they have a Hentai Fetish
Scarface and keep Al Pacino
Snorunt
That little dude is little adorable shivery boi
I love doing this to my husband with my tongue
Hearing him moan is amazing
Not saying it s right just saying that s the popular association
Forgetting Sarah Marshall keeping Jason Segels character
Only because the puppet show in the movie hasn t been given a movie and this is the closest I ll ever get to it
But if a girl did it to you why not ask women why they would do that
Panda House ninjas would be tough to beat
Arcanine is dope
Taken or any of the similar films keep Liam Neeson
The Sonic Movie but keep Jim Carrey
Would be absolutely hilarious
I seen cases where it lasted weeks to days
I had been texting this guy for a couple weeks wasn t super into it but he was really nice so I figured I d give him a chance
After being busy with work and putting him off several times I agreed to meet up at a nearby park
There was a large field and a bunch of hiking
He shows up and hands me a large bouquet of flowers which I had mentioned being allergic to most and also brought his VERY large dog after I had also mentioned being very allergic so I was already a little put off
Especially when his dog would constantly jump on me and lick me and he did nothing to stop it
We walked around the trails for a while and I could never get a word in
He talked non stop the entire time
Then we head back to the field where there are people picnicking on blankets and tables
He hands me the dog and runs off
He comes back from his car with a guitar and proceeded to serenade me very loudly in front of everyone
Then he just played and sang not well I might add for minutes
I still couldn t find a second to get a word in and just sat there while people stared
I told him I needed to leave for work soon so we headed back to the car
He gave me a hug which was very awkward as he was about three inches shorter than me then tried to kiss me
I turned my head so he kissed my cheek but he turned my head back to kiss my lips
I felt bad because he genuinely was nice it was just so SO he texted a few times even after I gently explained that I just didn t feel we were a good fit I eventually had to block his number and Facebook

Have you ever heard the theory that Donnie is a figment of Walter imagination
Almost no one else ever talks to Donnie
I personally love the idea of Walter randomly shouting Shut the fuck up Donnie for no apparent reason all the time
An endodontist is a specialist who only does root canals and root canal related procedures
They do not do general or extractions
Saying this is like saying go to a cardiologist not a general doctor
Yes a cardiologist is the best specialist to see if you have heart issues but if you have an issue with your foot they will not be of much help
A general dentist will work WITH an endodontist to see that the patient receives the best possible care
Ooooooohhhhhhh who lives in a pineapple under the sea

American pie where only Jason Biggs is human
Sell your bath water apparently
Did your mother drink during pregnancy
Related to that saying hello to somebody who was not talking to you in the first place
Happens too often to me once in a lifetime is enough
I woke up to the feeling of a presence behind now I seen the movie so this was especially terrifying and if you seen it you know what scene I talking so anyway I soon realize I ca move and lay there slightly annoyed but also scared shitless
Then I hear the voice of a child whisper directly in my ear Come here
That was all that happened but the presence was there until I eventually regained feeling and turned my lamp on
My life
My fiance grandmother used to be a hairstylist
She likes short hair
She trimmed my extremely curly hair in the past which has to be long for the weight to pull the curls straight ish
The past times she cut my hair were fine
Then one day right before a family vacation she insisted I needed a haircut
I agreed and as she was doing prepping it we had this conversation Grandmother You look a lot better with this short
Me no thank you
Grandmother are you sure
Me yes just a couple inches of trim please
minutes later after haircut Grandmother Are you suuure
I really Me No thank you
Please just a couple inches off
Eventually she finished and I went into the bathroom to see it
I expected the results I seen before though my head felt lighter and I felt she might have been a bit aggressive with the trim
That is not what I saw
She trimmed the sides of my head nearly down to the scalp and trimmed the hair on top of my head short enough that the curls had retracted and it looked like I had curly hair having been extruded straight up from my scalp
She walked in behind me smiles at me through the mirror and said Looks good does it
Now I not an angry person
I do really get visually upset
She knows that I a quiet person so instead of shouting at her for doing exactly what I told her not to do my eyes just slid across the mirror to hers and she knew in that moment that I was fuming
Nevertheless she said again It looks good
I raised my eyebrows at her as my fiance walked in who liked the longer hair saw the damage and we had this conversation
Fiance that
Shorter Me Yep
Grandmother nervously It looks great
Me I told her not to do this
Thrice
At that point I silently left the room and was shadowed for the next fifteen minutes by her grandmother who kept trying to extol the virtues of having a miniature beehive
She never seemed to understand why I refused to speak with her for the rest of the day
Also because this was right before vacation there a ton of family pictures recording this for all time
TikToks
I watched Nyanner stream for the time this week
IDK seems chill
It possible that catching it does give you immunity against catching it again so I continue to try and flatten the curve
I use cocaine and always drink a decent amount of alcohol with it too
The day after I either feel fine or I feel rough very emotional and physically drained
It easy to say that day after I not gon na do it again for a while
But then come the next day I just be like fuck it and do it again
It does even feel like a huge urge but it easier to do it than not to do it
I not much of a car person but I like the' Bel Air too
Mocked people for hoarding toilet paper
Shorty get doooooooooooooown good lord baby got up open all over town

I posted this story once before
Met a girl over tinder
Proceed to a later date at her house we decided to have a few drinks and see where the night goes
We both ended up drunk to which she tells me she going to bed and come in in
Fuck yeah except I too drunk to well you know I too drunk
I decide fuck it maybe she have more luck than me
Go into her room to find her passed out watching Shrek
I sigh relief because I knew I was performing tonight I cuddle up next to her and asked if she like me to turn off the movie
I shit you not
Shrek is life is all that comes out of her mouth
I think fuck it that more trouble than it worth I just sleep through it
It was a bad sleep but finally it ends and I think I finally gon na get some well needed z
Again no time for the second movie
I start weighing up whether I should just risk driving home
But the fact that the room was still spinning made the decision for me
This goes on for the rest of the night
Frozen and I think tangled where the next movies
The morning came round and I did even say goodbye
I left too tired to care about saying goodbye
But as I left tired sober me noticed one of her rooms was ready for a newborn baby
She had mentioned anything on the subject I was asking
Didnt speak to her again she did get in contact with me either
In the end I decided tinder was for me
And my mates have let me live down having a date with fiona since
Ah yeah that makes sense xD
So creepy
Some dude rested me offstage
It that sweet sweet YouTube money
My life
I never even met the guy let alone pee in my butt lmao

Because of the quarantine I had a lot of time to reflect and it been brutal
Both of my parents were extremely abusive and we cut ties about years ago this month
I have talked to any of my family and I dont have kids of my own for fear I would drag my subconscious baggage into their lives somehow or just not be strong enough to support them the way they need to
But I do have a dog and I love him and most days I feel like I dont deserve such an incredible doggo
Kudos to you man

Too much
It was a result of me feeling like he was the only one who loved me at the time
And he was abusive in more ways than one
But I m not with him anymore and and with my best friend now
I wish I knew what I knew now back then but I can t change that
Also other movies like The Shining Friday The Nightmare On Elm Street Halloween Hellraiser Texas Chainsaw Massacre

I have never enjoyed a Quentin Tarantino film
It seems like almost everyone has praises upon praises to sing for the guy but every movie of his that I seen has felt the
The pacing is always identical the characters are always placeholders and the stories feel like they being told by a filmmaker who not shut about all the that he put into it
Do you see this
every movie seems to say
Do you see
I telling a story
Look at this
Look look
Did you see how exciting that was
Okay now watch this part this is going to be cool
Everything just comes across as being so and predictable like watching a puppet show with Tarantino doing all of the voices
He has one character one story and one overall tone a melody for the movie if you will and I just do like it at all
DR I do not like Quentin Tarantino movie

I want a pc
I only have like and what I have in mind is like a build
My birthday is in August so I hope that I can get some money from that but I m only so I m not good with money lol

Just be happy do care if others are talking trash behind your back continue being yourself because you are unique
There is something in you that other people dose have everyone has something special because well everyone is different from others yes you can have a lot of things in common but that person is you so that makes you special
So the question is How to love yourself
Right
Well love the way you truly are even if you do like how you are how you act with other people just deal with it because that is yourself do harm YOU
This can sound very Dramatic but is the truth you are unique because there is just one you in this world
Just always love yourself How
Forgett about other people pretend that they are there always be yourself even though you are a good person just try your best to be nice to others and if they are nice to you just ignore them continue living your life because we just have one
I do know how people are going to take this but oh well i will continue living my life

And of course you dont get paid until harvest
They housed and fed me so it was fair trade
The kincade fire destroyed everything
Left me homeless
You cant get paid if there nothing to harvest
Was homeless for a bit
Fuck the California government
That fire was their fault
They allowed PG E to run rampant over there
And all they do is slap them on the wrist when they burns down thousands of acres of land
No increased regulation no improved standards no mandatory requirements for equipment upgrade
But hey we give them the power to shut down electricity for millions of people to prevent a fire
Even though their failure to properly shut down their power lines is what caused the kincade fire
I not still angry or anything
I worked a summer in a less populated area on a forest almost a million acres

I agree that if you spend your days playing the likes of FIFA or Doom you are really gaining much mentally ir sociologically but games like KotOR Mass Effect or Detroit Become Human fall off that mold and challenge you mentally and sociologically
It really depends on the game and the book as well that you spend your time on

Because furniture is expensive yo
s next is After many years of being single I decided to begin dating again
It was perfect timing I took a small job change that made a huge impact on my ability to have a personal life finally hit a financial goal I was focused on made some physical changes to my appearance and a family member who was incredibly ill is now doing okay enough that I don t feel like I need to focus spare energy there
I started dating a wonderful lovely guy
He s definitely the first one I ve actually considered could be a match and I ll admit I even hoped and daydreamed that he was going to become my life partner
He spoke about longer plans as well
A few weeks ago he dropped the bombshell that he felt drawn to the girl he went on a few dates with before meeting me
He listed all the things he didn t like about her as why it didn t work and then a few days later he broke it off with me to try make it work with her
She does not even live near here and they can t physically be together anyhow
It wrecked me
I ve been accused of being an ice queen before I m not I just don t like to burden others and I m well aware that I am so fortunate to have strong mental health so I think it really frightened my friends and family that I decided just to stay in bed and not eat for a few days
Anyhow long story short
I came out of the heartbreak
I still hurt and occasionally I find myself having a but they re decreasing in quantity and quality and I feel like myself again
This feels like a bit of a turning point for me
I have many more large changes that are coming soon so I think this might have just been a very good life lesson and a reminder that no one is infallible

On the small scale the majority of people can Justify most anything What happens the business that suffers due to people stealing food One persons desperation creating an others

Chevrolet when they unveiled the hideous Corvette

Paypal me a discounted rate this one time only
of to find out
Wash my hands thoroughly times before touching anything when I get in my house
Bc they make up for it in different ways
when i was in middle school i joined orchestra for the first time
our teacher was the most amazing music teachers and one of the best teachers in general that i ever had
she was super inspirational and really cared about her students succeeding and growing
she gave me an award for most improved after my second year and made me second chair for our concert only after a literal musical prodigy who was already studying at julliard not kidding
anyways when i got to high school our teacher there was the only music teacher for the music department besides the chorus teacher
so this teacher taught band jazz band was in charge of marching band and orchestra all the beginner and advanced levels
by the end of my second year with him i pretty much put away my violin for good
i never wanted to be in that class i never wanted to practice after school hell i did even want to go to the concerts
this man did not give a shit about the orchestra program he only cared about band and it showed
he was mean to students put us on the spot and called us out in front of the whole class for how bad we might have been playing that day especially when he put us on the spot
i didnt do orchestra for the rest of my time in high school and i barely played the violin since even though in middle school i was picking up on it really well and i really loved it
i was hoping that high school would just help me progress my skills even further but instead i got a teacher who expected us all to be experts and did care about actually helping us become better
i get it high school and you should be pretty decent at stuff by then but i was years old mind you
Certainly not bad idea

Probably the whole movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre after this shit I had terrible paranoya I was scared to sit in car seat thinking I can be stabbed by that ugly fuck from back
I also could go out anywhere when it dark I opened the doors pushing the knob down and kicking it as hard as I can because I was afraid of that ugly fuck with chainsaw whom I saw everywhere

Just a Friends reference
The fugitive and Tommy Lee Jones
Lots of reasons
The principle being having to film video vs take a photo
Taking a photo when you know exactly where the person will be and when you have bright strobe flashes isn t exactly difficult
Especially when you can sell the photo for huge amounts of profit offsets all the storage costs
Banks need multiple cameras at different angles recording hours a day and you can t be shining bright lights in your customers faces
They need somewhere to store all that footage so somethings had to give and that s usually frame rate resolution and colour
Hence why most security footage is or lower
Depending where they are they have to keep footage for a while up to a year or more
Banks also don t need to ID the perpetrator although that s helpful to the police
The bank just needs to be able to show their insurance a robbery took place
Bank robberies don t usually cost that much and happen so rarely that investing in hundreds of thousands dollars in storage per branch to have a recording running around the clock makes no sense from a financial point of view
I find reportable things on social media and report them
I find pedophiles it s obvious because they are posting actual CP

I have one of those really cool old staircases
A one piece unit
The whole thing comes down out of the attic on pulleys
About years old I guess
I love that staircase
I got to the top and saw that something was wrong
I tried to hurry on up
I was so close
One more step
Then to late the entire staircase collapsed feet down
The noise was horrific
I made the most awful sounds trying to breath
Crazy thing was as I was going up I was pointed east
After I fell I was pointed west
Landing on my back
I remember going down hitting the floor

Videogames were considered lesser decades ago but not today
You ca deny that they now a mainstream billion dollar industry or that many of their productions now rival or even surpass Hollywood productions in terms of scale cost media attention and celebrity involvement

That was and I still check back every couple years just in case
Writing touches us it feeds our imagination our fantasy our hearts

Those moments in which I feel ok like I swimming to be pulled under by whatever bad moment that occurs
My heart hurts
I feel like I need a hug but I am at work in another city so there is no one here
I often wonder about death and how good it would feel to just stop feeling but then I remember I am loved I am wanted and I am valued then I repeat this phrase over and over I am loved I am wanted I am valued until I am breathless
Every time I say it my mind replies back you are not you are less than you are nothing
I fight that
I fight the rejection the heartbreak the sadness
I fight the tears the shaky hands the elevated heart rates
I fight the disappointment the uncertainty the confusion
I fight the delusions I fight myself

For my part it not what you do it why and how much of your time your spend on it
It is not healthy to be locked in your basement and have no contact with people I do care if you playing games or reading books
If you play games or read to entertain yourself and stimulate your brain that one thing if you do it obsessively to escape reality then it also does matter which one you doing
I think that kids feel that adults or parents feel the way you describe about game and not books is because most people tend to obsess and spend excessive time playing games rather than reading books
no

Meal planning requires shopping prepping and cooking
Whom is doing this or if not where do you plan on eating
Who paying
There is an easy solution for your family by putting thirty minutes effort into an efficient system that works for both of you
Try a meal kit delivery service
Grab popsicle sticks and write your favourite delivery restaurants then place these into a jar or glass and draw a stick next time a decision is needed
When shopping for a a few meals and buy the ingredients
Pick up two prepared meals from a grocery store like Costco then it covered
Learn to make a pasta sauce
Cook your favourite meal double it and freeze the extra portion

I I think it was executed extremely well and is a cinematic standard that a lot of science fiction does not come close to matching
I think some of the themes like the scale of time the evolution of man and technology and the vast loneliness of space can be misinterpreted as boring or slow by many

I experienced the worst Crohn s flare up of my life on our wedding day
I knew I loved him and wanted him to be my husband before but this affirmed everything
I was so sick throwing up looked like a zombie dehydrated
He told me it was okay and that we would put off the wedding he was so worried
Woke up about AM the morning of he held me for hours after running to the store to get Pedialyte and soda crackers
I was sick but he reacted perfectly he was supportive and caring but also respected my wishes of not wanting to let my chronic illnesses ruin our wedding day it is an ongoing struggle
It was imperfect it rained I didn t look great I tripped on the way into the building I ugly cried happy tears during our vows
But I loved it because I love him and he loves me in all the chaos and imperfection
Ended up passing out after trying to tough it out at dinner landed in the ER got fluids and meds and was sent home the next day
He carried me into our tiny studio apartment and ran his fingers through my hair until I feel asleep
I knew months before that I wanted to marry him and spend my life with him and after our wedding day I realized he was the one and only for me
Health hasn t really gotten much better since but he still treats me with as much love care respect kindness and support as he did that day

Nah lol I m from NC and he s from Ohio
Someone sexual orientation and their sexual identity are often two very different things
He may be physically attracted to women feel an emotion bond to women that he does not feel to men
Hence why he wants to be in relationships to women
But what gives him pleasure sexually may be having sex with other men as a bottom
What gives someone pleasure sexually is not always correlated to what gender people like to be in relationships with
You look even cuter now than you did through my binoculars

How can I enjoy and yet be so emotionally exhausted by the same show
I went to my grandfather funeral my brother and I were to collect coats and place them in a nearby sunday School room
In that room was a giant stuffed gorilla
After we sat down there was a giant cross in the front of the church ad I just pictured the gorilla up there
So while the service was somber and a lot of people were crying I just pictured that stuffed gorilla being crucified
I stifled my laughter to the point that later after the funeral people were commenting on how this must have affected me so much I was audibly crying
I like to think my grandfather would have appreciated the thought
When you get down to it the wrath of Islam is just a pile of corpses
I would say try for a male and a couple females and wait a few dozen generations

Sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables sliced cheese or meat placed on or between slices of bread or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type
Source http Claims a burrito is not a Sandwich
Source https Just says the same
I think a hot dog is just a distant relative of a sandwich which has evolved into its own thing
Now a burger IS a sandwich so that pushes away hotdogs from the definition
Fargo
Keep Frances McDormand as the police chief

My teacher once did one of those reenactment activities where we pretended to be in the time period we were tried to teach us about the ancient Chinese philosophy of Legalism by pretending to be cold and stern snapping and yelling at us often
Having dealt with abusive teachers in the past I thought it was real and was crying my eyes out throughout the entire lesson
She eventually took me aside and told me I could wait in the library until the lesson was over
So how does that conversation go
Hey babe
You peed the floor last night

For about a week I started to think our house was haunted or something
I heard the floor creaking on my husbands side of the bed as if someone were walking around when we were both in bed sleeping I heard the garage door slam shut when I was home alone I heard the distinct sound of an empty plastic bottle falling on the tile in our kitchen
It was sleep paralysis
I ve had it all my life but more in the realizing hey I can t move what would be the WORST thing that could come in here in get me right now And then I would imagine whatever that was fun
But this was different in that it was strictly auditory hallucinations
I was really relieved when I figured it out because it pretty much stopped immediately once I identified it

I not an no questions asked but for some vaccines I opt have my children opt out
Why
My grandfather and my father and I all had mild heart attacks when having a certain vaccine

Phantom Menace is god awful
Attack of the Clones is meh
Revenge of the Sith is actually pretty awesome though
It s probably the heaviest one emotionally speaking and though the writing wasn t great the visuals were way better than the capabilities of the original trilogy

Hi I meant in rural Minnesota
His family didn t drive the only car they owned anywhere but to town and back
His grandfather owned the car and drove it to and from Texas where he lived
He died in an accident on his way back from Minnesota just a few days after he dropped my grandfather off from his year in Texas
The car was totaled in that crash
Everything else was with the horses
Their church even had a stable to put the horses in while their owners were in church
Many families were too poor to afford cars in this area because it s a rural farming community
so your admitting your a vapid arsehole who shouldnt ve allowed to procreate
Its the small things that count
An extra stepping stool of needed
I wanted to make an AMV with The Killers Read My Mind

I gave double unit of red blood cells at American Red Cross and gave pizzas to of my neighbors
I a cook at a pizza joint make bucks an hour living in a garage on a cot but worked this week due to steady business
Didnt want to brag in person didnt want to gloat but give never been happier or self esteem higher

Call your buddies find some hungry people and feed them
Give some blood money time or swear to the even more vulnerable

Hope you doing ok
When completely unprompted after a hard day at work my gf starts giving me head I know it sounds like I just being a perv but really she doing something that in no way benefits here and makes me feel good and I really appreciate that kind of selfless act not only does it feel physically good it makes me feel cared for and appreciated as her partner

It felt like nothing went wrong that year
Or maybe I was just too immature to care
I was just immensely bored from the onset and was audibly begging for it to end by the minute mark
Little did I know that was even the mark of the movie longest hours of my life
I have seen this happening on Facebook
Probably it because people know who each other are
Barbie was originally popular because it was a way for mothers to get their daughters more interested in make up and making themselves presentable
I do have a written source but it was in The Toys That Made Us Barbie episode on Netflix

Yup
Infinity War
Keep Josh Brolin
Kermit is Iron Man
Wheatley from Portal he deserved a redemption arc far more than GLaDOS

Other peoples opinions of me are usually good
They say I have a lot of potential to make a lot of money if I put in the hard work
I often feel that I don t want to be rich because I would just be bored and I know how much people suffer for less so the hard work to get there doesn t seem worth it
I don t want to be poor and suffer with those people either
I just want to stop thinking about the future but that leads to procrastinating important things which only makes the future worse

Sex worker
John Wick keep Keanu Reeves

My uncle death from a form of blood cancer last year
It really opened my eyes at the time
I was going through a depressive period while souped up on medication and unable to find work or continue my education
After his death something just clicked
I damn near had a mental breakdown at the funeral hyperventilating while thinking holy shit
He gone
I never had the chance to say goodbye and he gone just like that
His death made me want to do something with myself before I unexpectedly lose all the people I love in my life
After moving to a new state I began studying as a massage therapist and plan on moving out to start on my life anew
Miss ya uncle
Well that deescalated quickly Really I m not knee jerkily negative about any form of power that will address climate change
If safe nuclear reactors can be made I m all for it

Hmm Edward Scissorhands and the actor I keep is one of the best amazing actors in the world in my opinion and the guy who did play as Edward Scissorhands so Johnny Depp himself
I guess that would be some kind of animal lol
Never
But I do get too high and fall asleep often
My nightmare too at brought a girl he met on tinder to our house on their first date which is all fine and dandy except that his date brought her newborn
Like this baby looked like it was months I was horrified who the fuck brings a newborn to a strangers house
I was hoping she just stopped by but nope she spent the night with the baby inside his nasty beard neck nest
I felt so bad for that baby the girl didn t look like she brought the baby a blanket or even a diaper bag
I was determined to ask her to leave because our house is not baby friendly being a old Victorian with no central heating being put on the ground of his messy ass room and she kept swinging her baby in my small dogs face
But he took her home early next morning in his car that had no way of securing the babies car seat

Im a broke college student but whenever i wan na treat myself that what i go for
i like screaming in peoples ears its my hobby get over it cause your not allowed to hit me
The girl had a suspicious profile
Name sounded fake few pictures
We started texting and after a couple weeks I was not suspicious anymore
The profile was probably like that for personal reasons maybe she wanted to date anonymously
Since neither of us were looking for relationships I did care much
We tried to go straight to the point but since we lived very far from each other and I was that interested on her I did go to see her
One Saturday night she texts me to come over to her place
I got nothing better to do but she lived in a neighbor town and I did want to spend a lot just to get laid
She said she would call an Uber to pick me up
And also that she had a friend who would join us and I should spend the night there with them
This is where things started to look suspicious again
But I bought it
I was so uncomfortable that I did want to give her my real address so I went to the other block and gave her the address that I was standing in front of
I had a bad feeling about it
I gave her the address and she did reply for nearly minutes
It started to rain and it sounded like a signal from God saying Go home you idiot When she finally replies she said that she could call the Uber anymore with a weird story about her friend credit card and asked if I could take the bus
She did give me any address just a suspicious meeting spot
That was it my chance to give up and go home
I politely tell her that I was getting uncomfortable and that I would do it
She replied saying that I should go at first looking angry than changing the mood and the story and saying that she would call the Uber after all
I got kinda scared and blocked her number
And that when I realized I might have literally dodged a bullet
Unknown number call me
I deny and block
Then another
Then another
About different numbers texted me and called me all texted saying it was her and insisting for me to come
That was creepy as hell
Why would she have so many phone numbers and insisted me to go even after I declined
Her texts from the new numbers made me realize she was lying about everything cause she started talking about sex out of the blue like if she was trying to lure me into it
I ca tell what would have happened if I had gone all the way
I glad I did
Rob Roy or just scotch neat

Hey now
Like being on a boat but inside
I think the replies below pretty much explain why
I think it s because for every action there s an opposite and equal reaction
So pushing the thrust one way makes the rocket go the other way regardless of whether there s air or a vacuum
Everything
Oh man Imagine Fight Club with only Edward Norton as the only human and the rest as muppets
Fuck I would donate my left balls to see this happen
Make male actors a thing
The male actors in porn always have these huge gigantic penises and it can quite frankly be depressing sometimes
I m not trying to kink shame or anything people are into what they re into but it would be nice to see more diversity
The only time you see an average guy with an average penis is when he s being made fun of for SPH or some kind of cuckhold scenario
Just an observation
He seemed pretty chill about it to be honest said it was fine and was smiling maybe he was in shock haha

Thinking DisneyLand dark world
This question to me is so interesting
In the sense that in I hung out with my friends went clubbing most nights first year student went to restaurants actually visited family
I took life for granted in the sense that I would always complain about stupid crap
The point im making is that in everyone thought life was terrible now in it gets worse I guarantee you when it goes back to the way it was everyone will still find the same things to be angry about their life with
Do take things for granted in essence
No way is he having kids
hes probably got kids on every continent

I went on a date with a guy off tinder to go get ice cream well he faked a frantic phone call and said the line for ice cream looked to long and he had to go soon

I thought the Blair witch project was pretty damn good why did you think that
I only had my bottom wisdom teeth
Seems like that is kinda common
I had room n my mouth but still had to have them removed because without the opposing teeth there was a significant chance they would keep growing into the top of my jaw
At least that s what they told me
My thinking was that his bones would have that characteristic they would still grow

Most people find the experience to be life changing in a positive way
Well shit I though we could go commit some crimes together
But is incest legal there
As a man I always sort of been jealous of a womans ability to carry and give birth to a life
I know its odd but being able to give life to another human is an experience I have no chance of ever having
I always wanted to be a dad and can not wait to raise a child and would be incredibly happy to father any child regardless of whether or not they are biologically mine but knowing that Ill never have the level of closeness to my child that a mother can just kind of hurts a bit
I ca help but be a little jealous
I do like some videos
So shoot me
Fist bumps with explosions
I have not played skate but have seen friends play it
The mechanics seem simple enough that you could rehash the play style from earlier games and use Google view to draw maps

Proud of you man
I suppose it would be how I pulled myself out of depression and how I doing so much better than I was
After I let myself be bullied in middle school I chose to hang around my bully because I was too afraid of stepping away into something new and it only made things worse
I know it was not the right decision but it was a decision I made Flash forward to freshman year of high school
I had gotten into a rigorous high school where I did know anyone
I chose to verbally lash out against a lot of my peers mistakenly thinking it was the right way to treat people
In middle school people knew my situation and I think that they were nice to me because of it
In high school I got ostracized by my entire grade
At this point I chose to sleep through my classes and come home after school and played video games until late at night and then did homework
I do know how I managed to pass that year
I got hours sleep for an entire week many consecutive weeks that year
Flashforward to sophomore year I wallowed in self pity and just refused to talk to my peers because avoiding conversation was better than my peers ignoring me and me feeling alone in a full room
I chose to get involved in my NJROTC unit and try to better by volunteering in the supply department of our battalion
The people leading the department were godsend for me
They treated me so much betrer and I do know where I would be today without them
Some days I just was so depressed that I could barely function yet they let me stay and let me do simple tasks
Thanks to their kindness I dealt with my emotions one at a time
while hanging up clothes and inventorying rank insignias
Flashforward to junior year
My Naval Science Instructors veterans who head NJROTC programs at schools gave me a job in the NJROTC unit
I took on the job with everything I had and slowly started to develop confidence in myself and gain the respect of the people leading the battalion
While the job was not the most glamorous I put the most effort I could muster into making sure I made the most of myself
From the beginning of Senior year to now I got promoted in my job and now have people below me
I gotten special awards for my work in my battalion
I become so much kinder at least I hope and people started to talk to me again
I became much better at conversation and now I got friends
I got a lot better at flirting with girls and got a girlfriend who became my ex but that another story
Life is just so much better now
I am thankful for every day for everything I have
I have made so many mistakes but I just want to live every day and be a better person that I was the day before
There is no way in hell that I would tell anyone this stuff in person
I just could do it
Anyways this has been strangely therapeutic
Ima end this off here
Imagine mindfucking someone by subtlety changing your features like shifting eye or hair color your face getting slightly thinner or fatter the longer you stare within the hour you look entirely different and they do a double take

Went to the county fair with my date and her sister
It was going well until she pointed at this ride called The Bullet which basically spins like a fan and has two cars that are also rotating
I do really do spinny rides well but I did want to look like a puss so I puffed my chest out and hopped in
I actually made it through the ride without upsetting my stomach too much
She then pointed at the Pirate ship and I felt relieved that it was another spinny ride
We hopped on the pirate ship and every swing it made my stomach jumped a little higher
I puked a little in my mouth but managed to swallow it back down
She looked at me and said are you alright
No sooner than I said yeah I good
I blew chunks all that ride
It felt like it hung in mid air for a second and I have never seen such a horrified look on so many peoples' faces
An immediate chorus of STOP THE RIDE
went up as everyone scooted as far away from me as possible
Her and her sister ushered me to the car covered in vomit where I promptly stripped down to my underwear and road home sitting on a towel
We rode with the windows down because I smelled like puke and we had to stop so I could barf again on the side of the road
Once home I slid into bed and realized that my phone was was missing
I called them and asked if they could look for it then promptly passed out
Luckily they found it back at the fairgrounds where I stripped off my clothes
TLDR Rode spinny ride puked scared children stripped naked puked again lost phone

There was a guy that went to my college who was affectionately known as speedy Neil
He wore a blue and red anorak and walked everywhere really really fast
He used to lean to go around corners because it was more streamlined
I used to work for popular sub chain where you make your sandwich your way and he used to come in every Wednesday and have white bread with lettuce and ketchup that s it
He liked buses and kept a note of the reg plate and a review of every bus he d ever been on in a little book he carried everywhere with him
I think he had some sort of intellectual disability but he was a really nice guy and everyone liked him
Last time I saw him he was working in a local museum still walking fast and still wearing the red and blue anorak

Make sure you store them correctly
Some of that stuff gets kinda funky if you treat them wrong
Periods are actually a modern day phenomenon where women aren t having kids but are fertile longer
Back then periods were uncommon because it was normal for women to start menstruating later to have kids when they started menstruating in their teen years and have lots of kids and then went into menopause sooner
Nowadays girls are starting period at a younger and younger age and are having children much later in life and having fewer kids and going into menopause much later
Perfect thank you

There is an over the counter drug called metformin
My understanding is that it is usually used to regulate hormones in diabetics however I know a few women who used it including my wife to get a regular cycle which allowed us to get pregnant
I will tell you that many fertility doctors don t believe much in it because it s not specifically a fertility drug
We had tried for years and the month she started using it we got pregnant
I also suggest using ovulation test kits to know when you have the best chance of getting pregnant
My wife s body started self regulating without metformin and we got pregnant immediately with our second daughter so she was only on it a little while
I hope this helps you because I know how expensive fertility treatments are and how taxing the whole process can be on your life
Let me know if this helps you
I ll say a prayer for you both as well
Cider or sour beer
My second semester of senior year of high school only one class I was taking I actually needed in order to graduate
Unfortunately I hated the class and for me that means I did do any of the work
By the time the final exam came around I had a in the class
I needed something like a on the final to pass which is obviously impossible
So I resigned myself to the idea of summer school and put very little effort into that final instead choosing to focus on studying for other finals
After I finished that exam the teacher gave me the opportunity to make up pretty much all of the homework that I did do over the entire semester
After she entered all those assignments into the grade book I only needed a on the final in order to pass the class
Considering I got something like a on the midterm that I actually kind of cared about a few months earlier that was not at all a guarantee
At the time of the graduation ceremony I still did know if I passed the class
My high school allows people who did graduate to still walk across the stage and pick up the cover for their diploma but then after the ceremony we go pick up the actual diploma assuming you passed
I walked the stage having no idea it I passed that class
It was until I went to the area to pick up the diploma that I would find out
I told the woman my name she looked me up in a binder handed me my diploma and said congratulations
She had no idea that she was breaking the news to me that I would in fact graduate on time
I mentioned I needed a on the final in order to pass the class
When I got home after the ceremony I went online to check my grades
On the final I got a

My friend was a star and helped me out now I ugly and I proud
Literally nothing
I used to know a guy that when he traveled he would collect dirty from every town he went to
He would keep a small jar of dirt from that area and mark on the jar where it was from and what year he collected it
he had over jars
I just found it really weird but yet kinda cool at the same time

Not exactly body but my least favorite thing thing I hate about the body me personally as a guy is body hair
Chest belly leg arm and the hair that grows around the private parts and ass
It s disgusting annoying and I want a way to get rid of it to make it not grow back
It s just something that I believe wouldn t be appealing to others say if you were in a relationship with a woman
How can a girl be okay with weird body hair on a guy

Worst case whole roast chicken Clean the bird rub some olive oil on the skin salt and pepper half a lemon in the cavity roast til the juices run clear on
Leftovers can be made into chicken salad or eaten on a salad and the carcass can be used for stock
Joyrry Sounds like the word jolly spoken by a Mandarin speaker
Disengage emotionally
You can t change them or force them to value you as a person

They might throw a tantrum if you cut off their access to whatever resources you previously represented money attention emotion etc

That way they ca con you with those embarrassing overpriced photos of your mug
Not only that to truly love is to respect boundaries but the one who really needs to learn it probably YOU
We always hear that you have to love yourself before you can love someone else
I think it all too often interpreted as Time to go on a journey of so that I get the love I deserve
Sure it great to learn to be assertive
To not be a doormat
But if you stop and really think about how you treat yourself it probably something more sinister than just simply not having faith in yourself
There every chance you seeing something in you that you truly ca confront and taking it out on the world in some way
We often do get this message soon enough in our lives
My partner spelled it out way too many times for me
I eventually began to see just how harmful my behavior was
Their lesson learned the hard way was not to hide pain
They revealed their hurt to me eventually and that what also helped us both get on a better track
Having to see their utter pain as a consequence of my actions was horrible
It still something that drives me to a deep dark place to even think back on
And I ca take it back
This person I love so much today remembering them in those moments of pain that a life lesson that been very hard to endure

Why tho
Drunk I need a drink Me a Yeah I dont think ya do Then I tell them they can have a water and then serve them said water
Doesnt always work and sometime they get pissy about being cut off
But more often than not they actually agree that they in fact did not that drink
The smirk and a light hearted tone tend to ease the situation
Ai earning so cant afford anything
Yeah fine
I mean that people consider reading to be improvement even if fiction
It s either a Cartesian hang up with the mind being a higher faculty and therefore the most valuable exercise we can do or a romantic value on the imagination
Which ever way you slice it people consider reading valuable to our sense of person because it is either cognitive or imaginative engagement

Also this on mobile so the grammar may not be great
Background info I am a and I have my husband is a
He is literally the definition of mama s boy
His mother is the most pitiful and attention seeking whore I have ever met
His mother over a series of years has done terrible things to me and my family to try and separate us
This story about my baby shower
Setting March I was currently months along and my sister threw me a baby shower
After serious consideration we decided to envite mil but in this post we ll call her terrible catholic creature or tcc Let s start of with she wore to the baby shower she fucking looked like she was going to a funeral
Head to toe black with a big ass hat with lots of tacky and ugly feathers
When tcc came into the room I was flabbergasted she was wearing that to my fucking baby shower
Any way things were ok till we announced the gender guys this is when shit hit the mother fucking fan
So we had a cute pi�ata of a sweet or candy whatever so we break it and found out we were going to have a baby boy
Btw tcc was insisting that we were going to have a girl because over many generations almost all the family have had girls sidenote tcc was artificially pregnant with Dh that means she was not pregnant with fil sperm but he s still her son
She lost it she accused me of cheating which I did not said that it s not possible that we were having a boy
She started having a tantrum and when my husband said mum please don t talk to my wife that way it s ok she didn t cheat on me please stop crying or we will have to kick you out of the baby shower like the little mamas boy that he is
She didn t like that so Tcc literally charged at me and Tackled me and she started trying punching my belly but she was to weak to do anything serious
My dear hubby did nothing to help me but luckily my family helped me and called the police on her
When they were calling the police my family started to berated my husband because while tcc stoped and was pinned to the ground he was begging for us not call the police and also for not doing anything and letting his mother hurt his wife and potentially baby
Soon after we got into a fight because he was begging for me not to press charges I was tired at this point after all the years of his horrible mothers behavior and him so I said it s either me and your child or his mother
He responded with its you babe but please don t press charges she was drunk and didn t know what she was doing that point I lost it and I told him to get the fuck out and don t talk to me until you get your head out of her ass
I am livid and with all this covid bullshit going around I am worried for not only my health and my baby but also my marriage

There an implicit agreement in group games to play as a group and not disrupt things for everyone else
So sure do what your character would do but that will never justify being disruptive if you actually playing an appropriate role

My ex to mysteriously get the coronavirus
I understand this website s claim but at the end of the day we both got our information from the Internet
An ex and I took a friend out for drinks and a movie and on the way back we got to talking about sex and stuff
Friend mentions that shes never had sex and her anatomy made her self conscious
We asked her to elaborate and she says because of how her vagina is shaped all the stimulus she feels while masturbating comes from her urethra
She explains that for her it goes urethra clit and vaginal opening from top to bottom
She goes on to explain that she actually feels no clitoral stimulus and has to rub the opening of her urethra to get off
My ex and I involuntarily laugh and then explain the only thing wrong with her is her understanding of her own anatomy
Thankfully she seemed more relieved than offended
She was at the time

I matched with a cute girl that I randomly had lunch with at a college luncheon a month prior
I regretted not making a move then so I swiped right
We matched and decided to have dinner
After offering to pay and her refusing a few times over we split the bill
No big deal
An hour later I check Twitter and she is badmouthing me without ing me or saying my name saying I asked her to pay and that I did even have my wallet
She was then in the comments fanning the flames from her girlfriends comments
It may not have been the best date but everything she put on Twitter was a fabrication to get attention
Oh well
I decided not to reply
As long as my name was never mentioned she could have her story and be gone

The opening to Suzanne Vega Diner'
My ability to keep a secret
The women in my immediate family are all really close and in the past have tended to not keep secrets between us very minor ones mostly very well
For the past two and a half years I have kept a major secret for someone in my family and while it has honestly been pretty terrible keeping it I am proud of the fact I been able to keep a secret when it really matters
I am able to trust myself more now
Put some sugar on it
Fortunately I havent lost anyone to the virus yet although most of my family is pretty high risk
My mom is a type diabetic with a few other issues my grandparents are in their with lupus and heart issues so im kind of worried for them
Been isolating pretty hard though so we are hoping no one gets it
thank the people who got us through this hell catch up on donation backlog for places that didnt have the facility to accept online donations get things set for the summer there are chores to be done resume going for walks perhaps first at night when it likely to be a little less crowded stand in the sun and blow soap bubbles this is not going to be a sharp change it is going to be that one day the epidemic is there and next day it declared all clear it not a fete
it be a tapering off
I think we should get sloppy when the curve is dropping last thing we need is a resurgence caused by idiocy
and if the worst thing that happened to us was feeling bored for being at home suck it up people have it a lot harder
I do get when we act like we making this huge sacrifice being at home it not pure altruism it also self preservation

I used to live in a very small rural town
I was possum hunting at the time with my dad and we heard the fire fighters talking on his radio
the town is rural so most people have at least one radio and possums are pest in our country We decide to head back to the town and when we started driving down the main stretch of road we could see clouds of black smoke over the trees
At first I thought it was one of the big boat sheds on fire that belonged to one of the locals but then decided it was a garage in front of it
I directed my dad to where it was
this is a very small town and I spent lots of time running around it with my friends so we knew the layout well
by the time we were there the garage was fully in flame
I hopped out and could feel the heat from where I was standing metres away
I ran home to get my mum she was a first responder for ambulance
she was in with my sister watching Doctor Who
It took about seconds of banging on the door to get her to open it
I tell her about the fire and where it is
I know the people that live there but not personally
she has no idea where I talking about is so it takes awhile to explain
Again it is a small town so she could probably find it easily enough
she goes to get the ambulance which is parked in a shed across the street from us
my sister and I get sent to our friends house until our dad picks us up
In the end only the garage was destroyed but along with two motorbikes and a nice car
my mum looked after the lady in the house
she and her boyfriend were fine but very shocked
It turns out the fire was caused by hot ashes that the guy took out in a bag from his fire place and into the garage which then caught alight

respect your essential service guys because they do a lot of work for people like the guy and girl in the fire
Helping and caring for them in these times esspecially is amazing
thanks for reading this unessasarilly long story and sorry for any mistakes

You can not argue it any other way because that would be creating a for the child to be born which is impossible

Kevin Spacey s character John Doe shall remain
Dynamite would have been safer
I really liked to act when I was in middle school
I took drama for years and loved it
Until my grade year
We had gotten a new drama teacher and he was pretty cool
We call him dt
We all liked him
There were people in the class at the time I went to a small charter school
We always did this huge performance where all performing arts classes would come together to do a big show
I did really expect anything different this time
The previous drama teacher pdt became the head of the arts departments and he was the one planning everything
Usually he gather the dance and drama class to come up with an idea for a play but this year he went solo and came up with everything himself
When we received the script it was horrible
It did really make sense and I somehow got to the main roll
I hated my roll so much because the character was so confusing and did make sense
I tried to switch many times but he refused claimed I was just being a baby even though he let a few other people in my class switch their rolls no problem
Dt did like the script much either and even tried to get it changed but pdt did listen
The whole school did really have an motivation to do this play since it was that bad and pretty boring
We still rehearsed but we really just learned some acting skills and games from Dt
months pass and it time to bring everyone together for a group rehearsal
We did this a week before the actual performance to see how everything would fit together
In short it did
No one was really enjoying this
Students did really care for the play and neither did the teachers
Pdt would constantly stop everything so everything fit his idea of it
Never let anyone say anything and if you did he took it as being disrespectful
He would constantly pick on me and I had no idea why
Last year we got along fine
I liked him
He was a sweet teacher
I do know what happened over that summer but he became a huge dick
After being forced to a do a show after he threatened to fail every single student in the arts departments and hold us back a year I hated acting
I lost all love for it
Even years later I refuse to do anything that involves acting

The article I linked by Argonne was pitching nuclear fuel reprocessing on the grounds that recent innovations have made it even more efficient not just that reprocessing is theoretically possible
Spent fuel reprocessing has been done in many countries for half a century already just not the US because of political and economic considerations
The economic considerations being that the cost of storage is actually not very great and typical thinking in the US discounts the long term costs of storage as well

In early June one student in my year committed suicide
Rumour has it that he went to the school leadership in late May to get mental health advice and they told him to just concentrate on his exams know the ending
The school spent a week talking about th importance of metal health but after that they wanted nothing to do with the subject
You make your own conclusions
Humans are morons
Me and my friend have lots of these while playing online with each other that always get blown way out of proportion I ll list the ones I remember We were playing some game where I had to spam a button over and over and I commented on how I wasn t sure if he had always been able to hear it when I spammed buttons
He said he had always been able to hear it and had told me about it before
I said he hadn t and asked for when it had happened
He said he couldn t possibly remember but then after more screaming he came up with a specific date and time
I called bullshit and it just got worse from there
I was playing online with him again and said he had to go do something and left for about half an hour muting his mic
I turned on some music and started singing along
He came back earlier than I thought he would and didn t started listening in
I finished up and he unmuted and said that he thought I was a lovely singer
I got mad that he had been listening to me without my knowledge and he said anyone would have because I didn t normally sing
I thought he acted really creepily and he thought that anyone would have done the same in his situation
This one is probably the stupidest one
I was reading through some subreddit and saw a post that mentioned granny panties
I read it out to him and he asked whether or not I myself was familiar with granny panties
I said I wasn t as I am not an owner of any granny panties
He asked if I was being serious and I said yeah why do you have a secret stash of your own
He got angry called me a retard and asked me how I could possibly not know what granny panties were
I said I know what they are I ve just never had any myself
He got angry that I interpreted his question like that and I got mad that he called me retarded for something so stupid
We re still good friends and I can t wait to get in another stupid ass argument

My spare room was too messy so she opted for my bed
Ended up sleeping together

Window that I haven t dusted in some time
For now I think that the prequels are better films but it marginal
All films Prequel and sequel films are garbage I say because I cried the first time I saw the you were my brother Anakin
scene
It really showed how it Anakin was set up by Palps and it made me shed a tear
Either than that the Prequels were Sequel level garbage
The difference is that the Prequels were a gateway to a lot of Star Wars content I love from the Clone Wars to Republic Commando to the might series
The gateway that the prequels were and the memes that were later made make me sympathise more
Either than that the CGI was shit the dialogue was comically bad hence the memes and I slept through Attack of the Clones countless times

Plus it was packed with action scenes
I am no movie critic but i just really like this movie and its about time i watch it again
Well that enough Reddit for me today
And how would you know what it felt like living in the beginning of the Reich
If you sincerely think America today is like Nazi Germany in the you clearly do know enough about history
Before telling me how stupid I am why not google the subject first
If you do you learn that political parties opposed to the Nazis had been banned Jews were being deprived of the right to vote own property or travel freely Jews were being rounded up and forced into concentration camps where they were forced to do slave labor starved and murdered
Homosexuals and the mentally ill were arrested and forced into camps
Mentally handicapped people were sterilized
There was no free press and no one was allowed to protest Nazi policies
These area just a few a very few of the things you will learn about the beginning of the Reich
I am thank you

He accidentally broke the pipe

Someone happened to be sleeping casually popped out as he was talking to a coworker ready to leave work
And he found beers in a fountain and then drank them

Agreed
I ve watched them all and to a degree I like them all but purely comparing the prequel to the sequel I have to say prequel
The sequels were rushed and had too many retcons
Although even the original series had some retcons
Originally Vader wasn t Anakin
I guess the whole series was more fluid
I think the prequel did more for the universe than the sequels
That and the whole planet killing superweapon was just beat way past death and the whole palpetine thing was also recycled
If I had to rate them in order I would say original then prequel and then sequel but I have little zeal for the franchise and the movies did their job they were entertaining

I was hesitant at first but went with it
I go to his house we start chatting
He lets me know minutes into me coming over that the reason he wanted to switch to a home cook dinner was because he was his roommates who were tripping acid today
We kinda made dinner but ultimate was cut short by his roommates TRIPPING BALLS

It s really amazing how much we can impact each other with the smallest things and not even know it
Spag bog
friends and the office
There s no way you can answer this without coming accross as ignorant or delusional because of the no attractive guy uses Reddit stereotype
Purely based on interactions out drinking so on i will say i m an relatively attractive guy
I also use my objectively less attractive friends in this equation
It mostly comes down to women
Social interactions are way easier since women and guys come up to you without you doing anything
Women have a tendency to carry the conversation since they want your attention
Women constantly wants to add you on social media for me it s always Snapchat
Less attractive guys get really happy when you sit down to talk with them and really wants to be your friend
People have a tendency to remember you like I saw you weeks ago here without even talking to them
A bad thing is that people have high expectations in general especially when it comes to social interactions
I m a target when women are around so guys always wants to kick me down but not my overweight friend as example
Yeah that s the most noticeable things that happens
Harmless who cares
Someone jacked it to you at some point

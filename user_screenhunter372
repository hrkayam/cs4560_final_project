Hey I interested 
share the codes 

o did you make these designs 

https 
I ran mine into a streetlight in order to avoid a fatal crash 
Have a little bit of lower back pain from time to time but other than that unscathed 
Quite lucky imo 
The top picture looks exactly like my car after it was totaled earlier this year so much PTSD 
Too bad the island is full 
This was super cool 
I a big fan of lavender purple 
I wish there was a way to better differentiate lowercase and uppercase 
This is sick tho 
I love almost every movie I watch 
People question me when I watch a terrible movie and I love it 
I call it a blessing cause I m able to enjoy everything 
So there I was enjoying Sorry to bother you in bed when the horsemen plot point comes up 
I still don t know what happened after that scene 
The PowerA controllers can 
Source I own the wireless GameCube and wireless pro controller by PowerA 
Ca say I analyzed it that deeply but I totally agree about the day to day life point 
I think that why Half Blood Prince is my second favorite book after Goblet of Fire and favorite movie too probably since it a look into their daily lives at Hogwarts 
No problem 
It prolly my favorite fanfic ever 
I like stories that stick to the cannon but tell it from a different point of view 
Niylah not being absolute fave is a robbery But in all honesty I do wish we got more screen time for her 
Why is Niylah so low 
This is the super popular retelling of the last two books from Ginny perspective https https 
Huh I should have thought of that 
Thanks 
Where you get all the stickers 
I have a Niz Keyboard coming tomorrow and a stickerbombed case seems like the perfect way to customize it 
Ender is a budget printer around depending on what it comes with 
I personally bought an Ender Pro off of Amazon for and paid an extra for a glass bed 
Looks like an Ender 
Keycaps might be https https 
Maybe these 
https https 
Perhaps comparing to the Falcons is more appropriate 
All the pieces are there but game plan just seems so ineffective 
Let be real TSM does have a mahomes 
I argue right now we are even top in LCS 
We like the cowboys 
Dardoch is Dak Kobbe is Zeke 
Good but not good enough to compete 
Who is Patrick Mahomes 
Doublelift 
Definitely not why I turned him around 
https 
Just wanted to pay my respects to one of the all time greats of my childhood 
Lego Set Dad bought it for me years ago on clearance 
The old sports Minifigures had springs in their legs 
Meant they could sit down but they could simulate a throw 
It a stretch but for me as a kid it totally made sense 
If you do care about the box you can find these for around on eBay and there are of them out so quick maths says depending how good you are at eBay 
I trying to collect all of them as well 
Might have sniped me on eBay a few times 
Pokemon Conquest 
Criminally underrated spinoff 
This is the way 
Actually it a show on the cw 
Josephine Clarke and Niylah 
Some might say I have a thing for blondes Edit shruggie does look right 
Just want to point out that hauli hauli is actually yeah baby by Garry Sandhu but remade for bollywood 
What wireless are repairable 
I think you generalizing a little too far here 
The average customer today is much more educated with the prevalence of YouTube and reviews than in the past 
I also have a non standard hero 
I got mine off eBay because it was only released in China 
It colored after a cosmetic skin line in League of Legends called Odyssey 
Not in my experience 
I think if you let it sit in the dahi overnight it gets softer but not soft enough for my liking 
I prefer my boondi extremely soft no crunch at all which heating it in the microwave achieves 
Personal preference though since my dad prefers it crunchy 
I put regular salt before never heard of black salt before 
Will try it out 
Jeera 
You can use powdered or whole 
I prefer boondi raita 
I been eating it since I was young and it takes seconds to make 
Get some haldiram boondi heat it in some water for seconds drain the water add to a bowl of Indian dahi add some roasted cumin and you good to go 
I know it did do well on metacritic but I thought it did fairly well Steam 
Steam link https 
Wait what 
For those interested link https 
Ya 
I do think I far enough into the game where they explain her original name 
Catherine 
Is Macys really that expensive 
I remember buying that stuff for like a piece 
But maybe I misremembering it was years ago and my Mom did most of the work 
Macys 
Right now yes but that just how meta works 
There will be stronger champions due to the way the game is being played at a specific moment in time 
But you yourself said there are times when Leona is the better pick 
I all for more variety of champs so why not have two all in bot supports 
Gives people who want to play that style of support options 
You want aoe CC on a relatively low cool down 
Leona is a good choice 
You want knockups and near impossible to miss CC 
Go for Naut 
There nothing wrong with champions fitting the same niche imo 
Also I fairly certain nautilus is always the more superior choice than leona 
I feel like no one likes side printed keycaps other than me they are so hard to find 
I have both for but if they have the day DLC on switch I buy them instantly 
I do think akkadian died times this game 
I think the rep I speaking to is just incompetent then haha 
To get a return label 
Seems like most people are having an issue actuator getting to the return label and apparently they are going to send an email maybe with more instructions 
What zipcode did you use 
Same 
Is that a Yu gi oh card on the side in blue 
EDIT spelling 
What game were they playing 
Wow I get ping and I in California playing on NA server 
Sounds pretty nice 
TSM TSM TSM 
Is there a full res version of this 
I love to use this as a phone background 
Oh ok sorry 
It looked weird but makes sense 
I think you put ki adi mundis crown on backwards 
Smallville Tom Welling was my personal favorite 
My favorite game of all time 
Neither of these characters are from the movie 
Riot Blaustoise woo 
Super clean setup 
But it funnnnn 
Collectors man 
People want to own multiple for the sake of wanting to have backups or resale value 
Edit explanation 
Whats the keycap set 
I ca find any good sets for the keyboard I building custom 
Doing God s work bless your soul 
https 
It came minutes ago 
That what I wondering 
For the majority people I think they felt that it got too complex and convoluted 
As my dad said at the time most people do want to put the brain cells into the TV show 
thanks Mom but I do think this is gon na work for me 
Appreciate it though 
Aldis legs are like 
Prolly easier just to buy new ones 
You could try to come up with your own mounting system but the amount of time and effort might not be worth it 
Plus whatever you spend on that solution may cost more than just buying new legs 
Obviously getting your hands on the old mounts is ideal 
My guess is they are own whatever table top she had them on 
You could also try to go ask Ikea if they have them laying around but that highly unlikely 
I believe you meant hire not higher 
Nah they call each other mudda 
Perhaps maybe a dark blue would complement the setup nicely then 
It would depend on what furniture you you want to give off 
The three most basic ideas I can give are Red for a more look Blue for a cool contemporary look Black for neutral but good contrast 
My gut says red but it really depends 
Hm I think then you would need to add color in the form of either a rug or perhaps adding something above the top shelf 
LEDs add color but are also not going to add color to the setup 
Are you gon na put a tv in the middle space there 
I quite literally just bought the same ones two days ago for the same purpose 
Haha he is pretty cool 
But since I been a Claudia fan 
Favorite character hands down 
But they acknowledge that their choices are not easy which makes them awrsome Claudia is just more awesome absolutely positively no bias at all 
That would be so interesting 
Haha it was a great read 
That was super heart wrenching 
Ooh I was close 
Maybe Calia 
That fight scene was great 
Haha yes that fair 
But that part of the fun 
Is Claudium the accepted ship name 
Low key I think Soren and Rayla would make for an interesting pairing 
Send it over 
I just want some diversity Also I m a dirty Claudia Callum shipper 
I do but I think I m definitely the minority here 
Whenever I watch tv shows I always expect most of the main characters to be in their young teens 
Soren and Claudia to me are around I haven t really followed what the creators have been saying what are the social media accounts where they reveal this kinda stuff 
Wait I love to read this 
Obviously this matters on a person to person basis but I had no problem wearing them for an entire day playing league with my friends 
I also heard however that I have small ears so that probably plays a big role 
In terms of build quality i dropped them here and there maybe times in years and they stood up just fine 
They did feel fairly cheap though 
Audio quality I dont have a clue 
I dont really hear much of a difference between these and my sennheisers or anything and I never heard my own mic so I probably not the best to comment about it 
What about the is so bad 
I just upgraded from it this weekend and thought it was one of the best wired headsets I ever used 
Damn now I got ta try making one 
Thanks for the inspiration 
Ya for sure 
I seen a lot of cutout Pokemon cards but this is the first Naruto art I seen 
That sick 
What was the cutout material 
Just cardboard or something fancier 
I went last night and could find any 
I meant both Hermione and Kelly Ripa are quite beautiful 
I think that s where his outplay potential comes from 
How would you delay the heal and shield 
My exact experience 
So is his wife both in real life and on screen 
Yes you are 
The switch reads them as controllers 
Ooh interesting more world building 
Wasn t episode the end 
I think I have to change out the battery or something 
I never got it to work 
I have one but I never turned on 
Jealous 
I m looking for a cheap copy of radiant dawn I would have paid just for the game 
Maybe I m too young but I ve only seen one sale in my entire life 
I ve been using OfferUp and Letgo looking for people who don t know what they have 
Should I start asking GameStop what old school games they have in stock 
Are those prices better than getting them online from them 
https 
https

AliExpress Link https 
Similar games but I love the medieval aspect of fire emblem 
Yea I just moved here 
Which game 
As a member of both subreddits I feel very very conflicted 
Looks like I ll be watching the awards and football at the same time 
Second Pokémon stadium 
Great games both of them 
I think he shined in old school movies when he was very young but didn t transition very well 
Hum Aapke Hain Koun is one such example Though I may be biased cause I love that movie dearly and hold it close to my heart 
Personally not a fan of the plastic they use but YMMV 
For me it feels like a discount Logitech but not as shaped for my hand 
Edit I had the white one with glossy plastic on the top and a ceramic feel on the sides 
Wait same here 
The targets were behind a boulder so regardless he was hitting them blind 
I think this demonstrates how sharp his mind was which would contribute to his genjutsu skill since tricking people is more a mind game than anything else 
If you want I could do it for you 
It s quite easy done quite a few now 
If you re interested send me a PM 
Don t need one cause we have the power of the springtime of youth 
I ll see if I can one 
Guess I should have tried this first 
Thanks 
Personally I really like metal ones that I find on wish for 
Real treat was Fed running into albert s room and looking for Lily only to see Albert pissed and Lily not there 
Most people are playing diana as a jungler tho 
Source total number of games played across all tiers 
I never heard of an indian dish not use cumin 
For Tikka Masala you could in theory just use any recipe and not use cumin and instead maybe use a dash of tandoori powder and grab the same 
Not sure how it would work but try it 
source asked my mom how she would cook it if she did have jira cumin for tikka masala 
Happy Thanksgiving 
I take random spot 
This article doesn t even mention fnatic 

My bad fixed 
Alphari and Nukeduck are solid pickups 
Sheriff I have no clue about didn t watch much of 
Edit maybe jungle sup can make these players shine along with solid coaching and take them to a top tier team Edit not roccat 
I suggested this in class when he first assigned the project but everyone thought it was a stupid idea 
Oops 
Guaranteed he s extending this project 
There s apparently one dude who has it working but the rest of us are still struggling 
I got today when trading in for slim 
Shut up and take my money 
According to LS you did improve 
The logic is that every year the player base gets marginally better so the average player in silver this season is slightly better than the average player in silver last season I think due to experience don t remember the vod that well 
Thus by maintaining plat you did improve if only marginally 
From my experience info is one of the easier threads 
You learn a lot but courseload isn t too much to handle assuming you are on top of your shit of course 
I thought Houdre s class was ridiculously easy 
No need to show up to class or anything just do the textbook problems he assigns as hw if you want to do it EDIT Tests were actually a joke got a on each one 
Yup played with this man before 
Reminds me of my favorite piece of tsm apparel the season jacket 
Depends on the you taking 
Some people have a lot of free time and classes that do take attendance 
I think that might be a symbol of status through 
I m victim to wanting EarPods cause of how sleek they are 
The thing is you are an educated consumer which is not the same as the general public 
I d be willing to bet that at least of iPhone users don t know that other wireless headphones options exist that work other than 
Thanks this is sick 
Emailed 
Fair point 
I was just trying to find some ground where i could justify it but maybe there isnt one 
The pedophilia remark irks me 

We don t know the age of Tomaru 
He could be underage for all we know 
Furthermore it wouldnt be the first time Japan sexualized teenage girls 

Shows like Riverdale have been sexualizing teenage kids forever 
Don t bash the show for catering to the people 
Either blame the people or the industry itself 
Yikes that was harsh 
Worst thing you ve ever watched 
I can see it happening tho from the likes of this subreddit seems like most people wouldn t like it 
Ya maybe episodes was a bit much but I enjoyed it nonetheless 
It seems like he connected with other characters which was nice to see 
Maybe a bit boring but not terrible 
I d rather see that than nothing at all 
Actually if anything messenger is becoming more prevalent than ever 
As an ice sage main WOOHOO 
Me 
Used thanks 
This backpack is super nice I want it 
I have followed the subreddit too closely still trying to get through some of the older games myself 
to fire emblem 
Although he did commit crimes against the village remember everyone looks up to Naruto who always said Sasuke is part of the leaf village and it will always be his home 
If Naruto forgives him the rest of them will too 
Especially cause they all viewed Sasuke as their comrade 
If they did the whole Sasuke retrieval arc would have been what it was 
Literally Gaara Lee all these people had no connection to Sasuke other than respect yet Naruto was able to involve them emotionally 
Naruto decisions truly affect people and their thinking 
An example of that can be seen in Shikamaru arc where he says I must do everything I can to make sure Naruto becomes Hokage 
Why 
Cause Naruto is that important to everyone 
If he has forgiven Sasuke the rest of the village has too 
We just think we are 
TJ kids are nothing special that all I have to say 
Bingo Edit English is hard 
I p sure every NOVA kid thinks every non NOVA kid thinks everyone else in VA is from the middle of fuck nowhere 
Especially those from my high school if you heard of it which considering you go to UVA You definitely have Edit If you can guess it bonus points 
Do you know the experience with it 
I agree screw nova 
I trust you looking at the right stuff 
It just apallling 
I come from Fairfax County Virginia so stranger to good school districts 
It just scary to think of somewhere school is not so emphasized 
As someone who came from a studious household it much much easier to believe he got a on his first try than it is to believe that the average is 
Looking forward to seeing a female version of me in a game when I get around to playing fates 
So I just starting fire emblem currently playing 
There a character named Rhajat 
That so weird to me considering my name is Rajat 
Hey if you have file associated with this is love to have it looks amazing

Im screenhunter 
I actually have only dumped around hours in each fallout game due to boredom 
Combat is too complex for my gold IV brain to get through 
I enjoy playing them for a while but if I want solid plot something I heard the Witcher has I just watch some TV instead 
I personally have played any of those other than Star Wars and Fallout 
However I do see your idea that technically speaking every game is a role playing game 
Just for me personally most single player games are all just rpgs while more multiplayer games league of legends star wars battlefront etc are not necessarily rpgs 
In my eyes even mario is a rpg platformer which I guess is technically not correct 
My apologies if offended you I do have a very diverse gaming repertoire 
Just a few random games and a hell of a lot of league of legends 
By definition is Skyrim an game since you play the role of a specific dragonborn in the skyrim universe 
Rather than being mutually exclusive i believe its an sandbox game 
I would argue something more oriented towards an RPG like Skyrim where you can choose to do certain quests and things for people and depending upon what you done affects what people of that tribe think of you 
You pick a starting tribe and see where you can go with certain natural occurrences praimfiya happen as time progresses regardless of your 
What exactly are you looking for 
I would argue that as a result he became dumbledore right hand man 
His love for Lily led him down a path that eventually led him to be one of the most instrumental people in the order 
Sure he was what people view as an ideal person but I would say he was a good person 
Definitely not a bad person 
Also I think he did give a damn about other people but his hatred for James Potter who did bully Snape a lot along with Harry perspective lead us to believe that Snape is just awful 
I wish we had more casual pictures of the others as well especially Sasuke 
As someone who has experienced that kind of love before you have a point but I do think it necessarily makes him a bad person just a flawed one 
When one person matters that much to you everyone else does kinda go out the window 
Unfortunate 
Thanks anyways 
Would it transfer to my US account using cross save 
Wish they would have done this with the original 
Not having access to all the Digimon bothers me 
tHwG 
Ah okay makes sense 
Why run heat wave and flamethrower on Charizard 
Hum Aapke Hain Koun is now on Netflix and continues today to be one of my favorites ever 
I want one too 
There was another one with Ginny as well 
Same here 
Although we are based in NA we would love to have you 
All the time 
Considering my name is Rajat I always get a little confused when I see her 
I have cdr in my runes but I can hit these numbers 
It just depends on how you are playing 
Runes would help a lot I would guess tho 
Thanks 

That last line is really important 
It likely that the kids know that they are war heroes but being kids they undervalue what happened kinda just saying so what 
I know that kids today do appreciate the hardships their parents went through and I guessing the same applies to the Boruto generation 
If you want a support to play with pm me 
This was my first set as an year old 
Im hoping to get it again and see how my build skills improved 
Wow the digimon reference D 
This article was fantastic 
Amazing work dude 
That looks sick 
How you get them 
I never thought about professionalism when it came to peripherals mainly because I prefer comfort over looks but that makes a lot of sense actually 
That actually the exact keyboard that made me realize this 
I love that font 
I do own a magic force myself but I wish I did 
I own a few miscellaneous keyboards such as the CM storm quickfire TKL corsair RGB And an eagletec with switches all of which I think come with that sweet spacey font 
I definitely planning on doing some panel lining with some markers 
Im actually thinking about buying the same MG again and doing a comparison between my two techniques to see how much I learned 
I never watched the show but I had some Gundam stationary and walkie talkies 
Could you explain a bit more about topcoating 
I get the concept but I have seen a stark difference between a topcoated and non topcoated kit 
I definitely gon na pick that one up its cheap and will match perfectly with my Ground transport unit 
I definitely looking into buying one 
Probably with the next set I buy 
Any suggestions on the next set 
Customs are scary stuff 
I do have the patience 
Hm I highly recommend a clipper 
Everything else is pretty much secondary and aesthetic from what I gathered from my research 
I could definitely see a difderence between handbresking pieces and clipping them off 
But using an x acto knife and sandpaper I think have a much smaller impact 
The set is definitely need friendly imo 
Super clear instructions and nothing super complicated as far as I could tell 
But anything with clear plastic is going to be forgiving 
I think the set they have in the sidebar is a cheaper better beginnwr set if it your first 
The glacier is a great or set imo 
Yea I actually planning on picking up both 
I probably gon na buy another rk and build it using proper building techniques and then line it with a micron pen I own 
I already built it haha 
The clear nubs did turn out too well but then again I did do anything but use clippers to cut them off 
Hopefully 
I not too big on painting but perhaps given enough convincing 
Hey I have the same thing on my MacBook too 
UDRY 

Oh I must have missed that in the manga 
I believe Kushina and Minato were both from the leaf village just different clans right 
Unfortunately I do have access to a laser cutter 
So I guess I be sticking to wood for now 
Thanks 
TMK Firmware Builder I think you linked the plate case builder twice the firmware builder can be found here http 
Where did you get the acrylic 
A local hardware store 
I never worked with the material myself 
I assuming you used PCB mounted switches 
I ask because I think im going to take on a similar project 
Your finished product has inspired me 
You should try out a product called earhoox 
They work like a charm for me 
Well theirs your problem 
You bought an Alienware

Feelsgoodman 
Interesting read 
Shows that doublelift has grown as a person and a teammate 
Apparently I the only one who finds Clarke super beautiful and attractive 
She got everything I look for 
He was well known for his vayne since season maybe even I did watch LCS back then but he has played her in competitive in a very long time 
He basically turned around what seemed like a bad fight on his signature champ Lucian 
I really liked the characters on the OC they seemed very real in comparison to other dramas I watched 
Have you watched the OC 
Gossip girl and One tree hill were significantly better in terms of teen drama 
Sure 
Caught one in my chantilly neighborhood 
hopefully this works EDIT not for me 
apparently not 
i doubt its a ban just cause that would mean i might be banned too 
This has been happening to me since day 
Not sure if this is server issues or something deeper is wrong 
Generally just trying over and over again worked in the past but for the past minutes ive gotten nothing 
Yea only problem is you will need a emulator I recommend VBA and Desmume respectively but there may be newer emulators out there that are more robust 
I got a squirtle from a egg 
Digimon Fire Red and Digimon World would be up your alley if you like Pokemon style games 
Actually I just pulled the trigger 
Here to hoping 
Actually it seems like there are 
I have the same issue haha looks like its a battle between us two as well 
I think this has already happened 
This or the RX 
Looking to the pull the trigger on a card that can sustain at least on medium settings 
what about if you are going for 
You can check that your account has been created by logging onto the pokemon website 
Worked for me 
ordered and arriving in two days paid 
Yea I wish i had dual enrolled in Differential Equations and Linear Algebra as well I missed the Dual Enrollment deadlines so i just have regular high school credit for them 
For me the Digimon World Dawn and Dusk games were my childhood 
I did own any of the pokemon games so I played the digimon games a ton and grew to love the series through the branching evolutions which I thought and still think is a very cool mechanic 
Awesome thank you 
I dual enrolled with George Mason University so I requested a transcript from them so I can provide an official record 
If you could that would be great might try to build one for my college dorm 
Matt to me was the best big figure 
I never thought of agumon as a dinosaur but now that I think about it he does look close to a especially Greymon 
I think I liked Matt the most just because how level headed he was along with how loyalists protective he was of his little brother TK 
However my favorite digit on would probably be Agumon cause I love dragons 
However if we expand I think Veemon was the best 
What about information internet works 
I was planning on doing big data as well but I was thinking about II and systems and architecture 
I am willing to spend around to purchase the SSD 
Same haha

Hey

Im a year old male in the US

I am from NOVA 
its not really a deal though I think that the common price everywhere 
However it is better bang for your buck so I guess I agree 
http Heat spreaders on Ram are not important right 
Yes 
inch drives were initially created for use in laptops AFAIK Does mean you cant use them in Desktops 
I have fps at max 
Actually the human eye is capable of seeing around hz 
Oh do they use proprietary memory cards 
I should clarify 
I not looking for something to game heavily on I have a PC for that 
However I would like to play Cyber Sleuth and this seems like the cheapest option atm unless I can get my hands on a Vita for under 
Better AA 
Sure 
That actually what I working on trying to learn what are these different evolution lines 
The seems to draw heavily from Lost 
I think it meant to be a simpler version with a slight setting twist 
I agree with the first is the best general one 
Honestly I think the shows logo itself looks super cool I hop onto my computer and link you a picture once I get home 
Ah ok I see 
I definitely love to use what you have as a basis 
Thanks 
I need help as well but seeing that there really is none I think i want to become the help 
Awesome Id love any and all help 
Cost scales with the level of your digimon 
Lets say you are leveling up a level Patamon its cost will be per fusion material 
If it was level its cost will be like exact number idk 
Sure 
Thanks 
Awesome 
I just started as well I have no idea how anything works as of right now 
Is this a decent price 
In comparison to other sales i mean 
http 
This is hands down my favorite theme 
I intrigued by what you will do for Amazon and Netflix if you do them that is 
Do you use wrist rests 
I recently bought a Logitech and a quickfire rapid TK and would really like a quality wrist rest 
was my first set ever 
That someone was me 
I love your headset stand 
Awesome thank you 
Alright Thanks 
Feel free to give me any input on things I could have done better or any other tips you may have 
Dyrius 
They take it for themselves 
No TIP 
Sentry from the Series 
I look forward to independence once I in college 
I have one 
But as I said before my parents take the money 
I like this idea 
I see if i can get my hands on some clear parts if not I just use what I have 
I think you misunderstand what I meant 
I mean clean as in make the display a lot nicer 
Not as in dirty bricks 
On a different note I avidly watch the JANGBRICKS channel 
I think his content is amazing 
I ca own all the sets but at least I get to see reviews for most of them 
My most recent lego purchase was starfighter and the Lego microfighter 
I wish i could buy more but I just an year old teenager and right now any money I earn is in my parents control 
EDIT Age 
No 
I not 
You are 
You right 
I put up a notice 
Be a good citizen 
Thank you 
Thanks 
I think he will feel right at home with all my other minifigures 
I been too busy fondling over my new prototype Boba Fett Minifigure P 
Directed mainly at will you be releasing a moba version or moba keycaps 
I noticed that the only the WASD had the extra fancy keys and was hoping that it maybe came with replacement keys for us moba gamers who mainly use QWERDF 
This was on Route near 
Sweet 
Thanks 
Ohh I get it 
That interesting 
Thanks for the info 
I do see the connection 
Care to explain 
Which set is that 
I believe the Ithorian Jedi name is Rusty He is known in the Yoda chronicles as the guy everyone forgets haha 
It was a great build 
I really liked how they angled the wings by resting them on slopes 
Not mention that has a really cool helmet 
Saurik for sure since he has done so much work for the community 
And a huge thank you to you for providing us all with a great product 
Maybe not necessarily in Java but what did you create this in 
If done in a specific coding language I could help in porting it to other systems 
As someone who just climbed out golf bronze I find this statement false 
heh i just finished a game 
http 
I do think printing the cards will be viable but making an online version would be super cool 
The movie with Terriermon and Lopmon was the story of my childhood 
Another 
What was the first 
I c your username 
You are right about the hp 
However I find that extra attack points give me a lot more bang just because of multipliers spark boosts etc 
I do care much betwen the two though given the option I would probably pick Anima 
Generally speaking though I would always pick Breaker over Anima 
I see your point 
However just as an example i have summoned darvanshels 
Consecutively 
I maxed out the anima first then I pulled a breaker 
Then I pulled a lord 
I maxed out all three 
What I found is that Sure anima gives my another hp or so but what does that give me 
I would much rather have a bit more offense than a bit more defense just cause I prefer being stronger than sturdier 
But then again 
What do I know P 
I have the opposite darvanshel a but no zelnite 
I was just about to post this 
I had the same exact run as well 
Congrats 
I so close points 
I a good matchup as well Hunter wins losses 
Bloodyd is a good matchup points wins losses 
Add to the bad list He has wins only has points 
I also known as Ciara in the IRC chat and I working with Havvy and in creating a more functional bot capable of providing information to the users instantly 
Uh I would like to nominate myself 
I a pretty responsible guy I could help with IRC as well as keeping the subreddit page functional 
By profession I a programmer so I think I could help out here and there 
I personally like type AI 
I feel 
Maybe i just having terrible RNG 
Damn i applaud you for your patience and skill 
Hmm not a bad idea Time to max eve I guess XD 
I was trying to build the best arena squad with my units https As of now I have in order Hogar Grybe Dia Lead Dilma Zephyr I winning consistently but I was wondering if I could make this any stronger 
Thanks EDIT formatting 
How do you do this 
This is amazing 
Zelnite and elza That all I am missing 
I not too fond of the dragon batch so I do really want any of those units 
After tries I was still in the second rank on TVA My squad was even that terrible either Bad RNG I guess 
Please give it to me 
I have no zelnite after summons 
Luckily I have everything you mentioned 
Im still going to try to pull for zelnite again so I can use him as a leader but If not I use this 
Maxing units is an issue now that the evo dungeons are up EDIT Thanks 
I like some help building my earth vortex squad 
My units http I know for damage i need double dilma but other than that I clueless 
Princess Lidith 
Sadly I will be farming gems to pull multiple times for a zelnite 
This guy knows whats up 
I just got rekt 
Tiara was one of my first units she was anima She was also the second unit I maxed ever 
She is not in the meta but she is not weak in my opinion 
You have been cursed by RNGesus 
All you can do is pray 
For taking all the good units from the RS gate and leaving me with signas and tiaras 
You can donate me a zelnite pls EDIT Will trade you my Darvanshell dupes 
You are so i hate you and never want to see you again and I hope you are damned with oracle Ziz 
Thankfully yes 
Chogath is really strong in the jungle rn in my opinion due to his insane passive regen 
they release maiden stars EDIT They did release maiden stars so maybe we can hope 
Pumburkiny already has a higher level cap Why cant frosty be OP that would be so great 
Stand aside Maxwell Frosty is the new OP meta leader 
I totally understand 
But as i said down below i do think they should be realsing any new content until they upgrade their servers or else we are going to have more connection errors than ever before 
But new units is always nice i need evo mats so badly but I dont have the unit space to hold more than at a time 
If they had made frosty a more viable unit I would have been fine with all of their crap 
But honestly let face it 
Until they upgrade their servers they shouldnt release raids since everyone is just going to complain about connection errors 
I enjoyed maidens and things too 
I guess i liked them more as a small company rather than a money making corporation 
I used Tiara for the longest time 
I had elimo but I liked Tiara so much better 
COnsidering a lot of my first pulls were oracle it worked out pretty well since i was healing to full every turn 
If you have really high rec HoT actually becomes more effective than burst Heal imho 
Imagine me and my 
It not like i have a bunch of fusion units saved I literally have units that are all at Lv 
Max right now 
Good to see a fellow Chuck Fan on this subreddit 
I do have enough space to efficiently farm evo units 
Im sitting at units with unit space 
I given up on trying to summon him or Lily Matah EDIT My Darvanshells taunt me 
basically i need zelnite 
I try I filled every pokedex including ORAS 
Literally every single unit I have is maxed now all of them 
on NA anything would be nice Happy holidays to everyone 
I now have one of each type P 
Instead of Tia they put Thia 
I just want a ward skin or a mystery gift either would be deeply appreciated EDIT NA 
I would like a ward skin if anyone could be so generous 
The riot ward the battlecast ward or the bouquet award would be nice but any ward skin would be appreciated 
NA EDIT a mystery skin would also be acceptable 
Brutalizers XD League of legends reference 
Personally I think it the fact that they release too much at once Super honor summon trial of the gods and frontier hunter at the same time 
If they did these consecutively rather than simultaneously their server load would be in small bursts rather than these connection error full heavy periods 
Story of my life P 
Actually I gave up trying to farm metal mimics I encountered one today out of the runs and I did even recruit it 
I do have any proof but whatever believe what you want I was just sharing a funny story 
ditto 
Not sure if I want to take the time to evolve another one 
Or i might just use both XD 
Considering I just maxed an oracle one for eze im really salty 
Lord Dilma 
I ca even beat battle for level of the vargas dungeon 
this 
Use this link http 
Thanks for the feedback 
Waiting for info in the datamine 
Once she is released I will add her 
I add him in 
Thanks 
Will do 
I take a look 
Feel free to request units here link http 
I went with a Zebra lead Rickel Lillith Duel SGX Zephyr and Maxwell friend and have decimated every dungeon But I ca beat GGC 
Same here ive gotten Anima and Lord so far each dropping on my first run 
Lots of love for azael here I add him soon

I hope so 
we had like viewers hoping for some positive response 
Good point both of them will be added thanks 
Thanks 
I been trying to work on it about an hour or each day but usually its just about min 
Added descriptions will be put in soon EDIT Word choice 
I take a look after I finish Damage Reduction 
Fixed 
oh ok thanks 
looks like Gawd Luther to me 
Thanks 
I stick with elimo then 
Hey guys I have a question on which healer to use in the long run My current squad is Darvanshell Lillith Grah leader exvehl I have Guardian Elimo Breaker Lancia Lord Lancia Guardian Rashil Lord Themis Thanks in advance 
If you go through with this I would be glad to help you in any way I can 
I seen something along those lines Jarvan top Nunu jungle Kata mid MF adc and sona supp 
Want to know something 
I pulled Ciara yesterday Around minutes after the fire bulb event ended I feel you dude 
Just summoned for fun and summoned a star breaker Ciara Theres no way I will be able to do the level dungeon now right 
I would try to but I dont have any of the mentioned units other than Zebra and Duel and on top of that neither are maxed 
Why are you fusing away golem 
this 
Why wait if correct answers have already been given 
I agree Gumi was doing so well with its updates and then it throws this at us 
Wow ok I was just riding off how hard Vishra carried me so far 
I look into Crit and teams after I level up these Guys Thanks 
I pretty bad at building teams so I was looking for some pointers 
I just beat Karl and Grah and am Looking towards beating Maxwell soon Problem is I can barely make it through the End in Frontier Hunter Terminus annihilates my squad in seconds 
I also ca defeat any of the level legend dungeons which depresses me to say the least since i beat all three of the Trial of the Gods Dungeons Right now my main squad is Or Lillith if I using Grah Ronel Zephyr I was thinking of building a boss killer squad as well Grah Lead Lillith Rickel Zelha Amy Any help would be much appreciated 
Thanks 
Here is the link to all my units http 
Meh since the Nerf to zebra I lost hope in my crit squad How am I supposed to beat the GGC now 
I feel you I still levelling mine Too bad Zebra got nerfed hard 
Of course today is the day I finally recruit Zebra 
So i just got my zebra today after an oracle lunaris pull I finally captured a zebra Anima too 
Here my idea for my crit team Zebra Leader Duel SGX Lillith Rickel Leorone Thoughts 
And are there better options now other than leorone 
THe entire TSM team just followed him on twitter so I agree TSM Santorin 
How long does it take for a Hunter Orb to regenerate 
I know where it is live around minutes from there I live near Greenbriar West Elementary School Chantilly Area 
Northern Virginia Fairfax United States 
I use him in my main squad He actually deals a great deal of damage and I would consider him a high tier unit He may not bring that much utility but he definitely brings a ton of damage 
I feel like these should be added to the menu tab up above 
Hi I looking for leads I generally run a maxed lillith dia or grah lead but right now I using Ronel for Trial Friend code I gift accurately I active at least once an hour Level EDIT Thank you to whoever friended me 
Thanks to you I beat Trial 
I like to personally thank you so if you have the ID Siff pm me 
I think for now I stick with Vishra until Orwen star version is out 
Thanks 
AS of right now I my squad is Lillith Ronel Elimo and Zephyr I do think I need another healer ANd just curious whats wrong with a vishra 
He carried my through a lot of battles Including the GGC for Lance 
So recently summoned a breaker orwen so I was wondering what fire type should I use in my squads 
My fire units Breaker Cayena Guardian Cayena Anima Vishra Guardian Vishra Guardian Dia Breaker Orwen Anima Vargas Lord Vargas Breaker Phoenix Anima Lava Guardian Galant Breaker Lancia Lord Lancia Thanks 
EDIT Right now I use my maxed Guardian Vishra 
problem is for some reason i can never curse enemies unless its in arena I think im going to wait until i have some more sbb lillith im looking at you until I try it again 
I feel you buddy I have had any luck with these trials either My current team Ronel Lead with SBB sacred jewel Vishra with SBB medulla gem Elimo with BB guardian cloak Lillith with BB brave emblem Zephyr with BB brave crest They are all and I trying to level brave bursts at the same time I do have a ton of great friends so I try to refill for either a grah zelnite or lillith leads But really my squad is no match for this I use all my heals for Weiss himself If I get past Weiss Luna destroys me The one time I made it past Luna I was stuck cause I could kill him in turns I just get completely wrecked by RNG every time 
I think it depends on where you are in the game 
As someone with less than superior pulls I happy just for any friends I have 
It runs perfectly fine Source I have a late Macbook Pro upgraded to Yosemite

this better happen or else

SUPER METAL PARADE CONFIRMED 
See the imgur link 
No as in now I have different metal parades 
I actually find it not terrible in ARAM 
Especially on champs like vayne Edit I meant any adc on who you can spam spells like MF q sivir q and w corki everything etc 
Oddone to every new Suscriber Welcome to the average d club 
Pretty sure the best support NA is either Aphromoo or Lemonnation possibly even Lustboy Edit Not saying through mechanics or so but just in general making plays and such 
I just do see xpecial carrying the team with amazing plays 
Generally it seems like Quas or Voyboy and IWD 
I know I have so many level units it kind of sad 
Can confirm I having the same exact issue Edit Actually it seems that the Launcher was just updating and now it works as intended 
I feel you 
I have a guardian elimo too 
What do you have to offer 

Attack crit malphite just cause I like the animation 
Sword of the divine Stattik Shiv PS Zephyr etc 
Now go clap them minions 
Lol I just tried this while trying to get a light nymph 
Its so satisfying XD 
I so sorry I glad you got one 
I burned through gems for this 
Woah front page 
Thanks guys only my third post ever on reddit 
It a matter of preference really 
I like units with more attack so for me the ordering breaker anima lord guardian oracle It also depends on what you are using her for either a spark team or rainbow team But really the top three in my opinion would be either lord anima or breaker assuming you are using her as an offensive unit 

Maybe I should have thought this through 
You are kidding right 
summons Eze Vargas Lance Atros And just as a side note I gotten Larios 
Link please 
I feel your pain runs drops 
From What I have heard she is even that great of a unit 
MY guess is that this doesnt work anymore 
I having the same issue I have fused and won arena battles and it still shows 
Join this one 
http 
I think that the website should just be taken down and fixed 
I sure we do mind the wait 
https 
It was easy right 
Yea I would mind this either 
What did you use 
Actually sorry never mind 
I just found out that I can breed my Manaphy in X and I thought Phione could only be bred from a Manaphy in a Generation game 
Sorry 
An event celebi 
I not into competitive so 
I like to trade for your phione if possible 
Dyrus by far cause he literally will say nothing until something really weird happens and he start cracking up so hard so basically most of his videos on hid youtube channel 
Oh but they are 
I would like to see Aatrox jungle or top just cause I love his playstyle 
Obviously he is at the level of super tank but His jungle sustain is amazing ad his kit leads to insane ganks 
He also can clear objectives really fast 
Me too 
If they are truly your friends they can look past that 
Ii hate to say it though but they might not Hate to burst the disney bubble 
Probably not 
Even though its true Teemo was the reason TSM couldnt do anything cause of the shrooms its TSM fault that teemo was able to place so many shrooms 
Their early game lane swap did not work out as pushed out boot lane towers before TSM even got top lane 
It only got worse from there 
The loss of towers combined with a weak jungler led to teemo being able to completely shroom the map 
Kill games Thats scary 
Most games I end up something along the lines of either or 
I do really care whats op or not as I try to go for champs that fit my playstyle which seems to generally be either not to go in at all or go all in bursty all in champs like katarina 
I have stopped playing as frequently as I used to because I originally had an asus gaming but after it broke I was given a new Apple macbook pro which seems to have some internet issues 
Its been a hard transition 
I also find it hard to carry my team in general due to the large amount of raging and feeding in normals as well as my lack of understanding about proper positioning 
I heard it both ways 
Thats what I am trying to do 

Why not chibi 
I can play just about any role but I do have a lot of champs because I do have a lot of IP due to a lot of losses 
Right now i working on getting full rune pages one for ap one for ad 
Problem is I cant afford to buy rp for more rune pages 
Edit Spelling 
Yes 
I have around normals i think but only around wins 
Is Miss fortune an Ad caster 
Would make more sense to build attack damage rather than attack speed 
I used to play a lot of miss fortune but recently she just seems to lose lane to the current meta lucian annie and jinx 
Rattatas on one side Bidoofs on the other

Well its not for sale I like unusual cards like shining dark lv etc 
Ok thanks for the info 
How many different shinning cards are there 
I have a Latios Latias and a Jirachi given to me by a friend 
Im pretty sure this one isnt 
reply nvm i found the answer online and guess what This version isnt but i have another that is 
what does it mean to be shadowless 
Does this count 
http 
WOW I have a few of those lying around upstairs 
I going to have to check what edition they are Edit Random spaz of letters 
Any idea how much a mint condition one is worth 
Thanks man You are the best 
It great for finding locations of pokemon etc 
and its more reliable than the apps popping up these days 
Do give up hope yet 
If I ever find the time I might try to convert it with Ray permission of course 
I like it 
Either Gengar Golem Raichu or Snorlax 
The roller blades will either replace the running shoes or the bicycle or they might be a completely new method of transportation 
I did not know that Thanks for the great info 
This is amazing 
I understand your pain 
I now and I wish I could have been part of it too 
Torchic Thanks so much 
I have one I found it on the floor of a target What is it used for 
Yeah Hard to get to level though 
yea download from there

oh man That sucks

Love this Game

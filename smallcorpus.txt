Oh no you making massive assumptions about my stances by grossly if not intentionally misinterpreting what I saying
What a surprise No
I do think most minorities hate Republicans but I sure as hell think most at the least believe that they dislike them
And were we talking about minorities or poor people
Not to mention that the poor were as has already been stated less of a substancial player in than the aforementioned minorities
The differences in how each voted were leagues apart
Well since liberals do believe in the soul anyway then it really does matter does it

I met this girl on tinder and we immediately hit it off we kinda shared the same interests and we hit it off To be honest this was my first ever tinder date and i was kinda nervous so pretty much we switched to snapchat and started talking alot there and we got pretty tight
So she sets a date which i was very half half about due to me being nervous so i ask her when and she said the next day because she s traveling so i just said fuck it and went with it
It was a Saturday AM where the plan was we chill in the car and I remember that my sleep is super fucked and that i had to get up early to see her and I didn t even make my mind up about her yet all i knew was I m gon na meet her and decide then
We meet up and i hop in her car and she parks in a quite spot where there s pretty much no one there and She mentions that i sound like an old friend which I just brush off and joke about
Then an hour passes by and we start getting closer and closer I started to feel her up abruptly she said I can t do this to which I just immediately stop and look into the roof of the car and contemplate everything how i woke up early and showered to just meet her
Apparently the reason was because I sounded like an old friend as mentioned before and the reality of the situation hits me hard that this won t ever work out even as a fucking one time thing or a fling so pretty much i sat in silence as i tell her i think i should leave plus you got a plane to catch and all i was thinking about is just how fucking shitty my luck is when it comes to dating and how every time it ends up something similar like this i leave and as i hop into the car she calls to ask if im okay and she doesn t want to feel like a bad person and honestly i wanted to say that she is but alas i say don t worry and to be honest I don t know what to say
just don t think about me if you want to feel better and pretty much that was the last time we talked and honestly it really fucked me up and I m still waiting for someone to eventually to pop up
There you go reddit thats my tinder horror story that still haunts me TL DR met a girl and hit it off we met up first tinder date as it started to get intimate she said she couldn t do it because i sounded like an old friend who was an

I love telling people about this one
It be a from I was walking through a shopping mall with an unnamed friend and I came across an aquatic pet store that the sign out front said was owned and operated entirely by vampires
So being the curious one I entered the shop without my friend
I started walking around and there was an abundance of vampires in the store but none of them seemed to acknowledge my presence until I met a tall willowy vampire lady who had long platinum blonde hair and wore a red dress
She greeted me warmly placing her hands on my shoulders and welcoming me to the shop with a smile on her face
Before she got the chance to bite my neck I asked her if she was familiar with my friend
The lady then got very excited and skipped to the store back room without any explanation
A minute passed before she returned with two duffel bags the sizes of kayaks and a pair of orange panties
She told me to hand the panties and one of the duffel bags to my friend as she would know what to do with them and that I could keep the other bag for myself
I agreed to the odd request and left the store carrying the two giant duffel bags numerous other shopping bags and a pair of orange panties
I met back up with my friend and as per the agreement gave her one of the bags and the underwear
I felt strangely depressed after completing my task

One night my ex and I were getting take out food on the way home
This place had good onion rings so I was going to order some for myself
I asked her if she wanted any
She said no
I asked if she wanted me to get a larger size so we could split them
She said no
We order get our food and start the minute drive home
I driving and she opens the bad and grabs one of my onion rings
I said that hey you said that you did want any
But ok just take one or two
She said ok and eats
I focused on driving and simply continue to drive home
When we get home she stuffing another onion ring in her mouth
I look in her hand and see the empty paper sleeve that used to hold my onion rings
After saying twice that she did want any she ate my entire order of onion rings during the minute drive home
That one of the reasons that she my ex
She was so damn inconsiderate that I could take it anymore
Well it was also all the cheating that she did

Speaking as a guy imagine if you two knew how to communicate and solved that dispute without throwing a punch
There is a universal women are gossipy men are violent dichotomy
I known men who were backstabbing manipulative scumbags and thuggish women
It all comes down to variants of shittiness
Communication is an important skill to build for everyone
The military is definitely an exception to this rule
I doubt it their not really organized like that
The only thing they ve done so far was send so random work home for the elementary and middle school nothing for high school yet

Die Hard was my first answer too
Except with keeping Bruce or Reginald VelJohnson
My first serious relationship was with someone who experienced some childhood trauma
I tried to be supportive however I could
She had some issues and I always stuck around and tried to be there
I started dealing with some PTSD after deployment and she eventually decided that I guess two people with issues was too much and ended it
Somehow she broached the subject that the only way she could come when we had sex was if she closed her eyes and pretended it was some old guy fucking her
I was sure how to process that revelation
I still hope it was more her being messed up than me being shit at it but I accept it could be some combination of the two

she d keep turning and laughing with her friends then turn back to me and laugh and say she s just kidding
But she made this same joke like times
She also continued to ask me if I was gay which was pretty out of left field
Eventually when she turned and laughed with her friends for the last tine I just said fuck this and left without saying goodbye
I am a boomer this should not have made me laugh

My last crush was someone I worked with
On his last day I sent him an email saying that I had really enjoyed working with him and getting to know him and I gave him my number
He told me he d be in touch but I never ended up hearing from him again
I feel proud of myself for trying though
It s hard to tell someone how you feel but it s even harder to live your life wondering what could have been

I genuinely have been impressed by how conservative he has governed
The Democrats have lost their minds in every possible way and it is infuriating how irrational and powerhungry they conrinue to be
Just when you think they ca go lower they surprise you
I will acknowledge that he was as serious on the thing as soon as he could have been tho he did mention it in the speech pelosi tore up fyi but no one got this right
Since he has seen the seriousness of the situation he taken to it as seriously as he could
Governors on both sides have praised him for his support
The states are the main ones who fucked this up
Heads definitely need to roll over this clusterfuck but Trump is one of them
Also he did fire people in the cdc

Met up with an attractive guy from Tinder for drinks at a semi fancy restaurant
When I got there he was lovely and bought my drink and didn t seem drunk himself
Flash forward minutes later he tells me he just came from his uncle s funeral and I was shocked
I asked if he was okay said we could always do this another time if he wanted to be with family etc
but he insisted we go to another bar
He proceeds to get absolutely smashed to the point where he could barely stand and was making everyone in the bar uncomfortable
I walked him out of the bar no easy feat as he was over and I m and drove him home
We weirdly enough went out again to a super nice dinner that he paid for but he wasn t for me
My friend told me that I saved her life from from depression and suicidal after we knew each other

My answer obviously was of course
Persephonies ashes are atop my bed frame in the window sill and I look at pictures of her every single day
Some days it still as hard as it was the first day other days I so happy to have the memories I do
I glad you got the time you did with your baby it so incredible how they treat us

Elmo kills the dog
Honestly he told me he liked me and wanted to move forward with our relationship
I realized I been dumb for the past month of Snapchats and phone calls and that yes he was attracted to me and no I did see him as just a friend
Then I said that at the moment I wanted to get to know him better first and he was like well what do you want to know about me
How old are you
I never asked
And he told me he was only and I was relieved because I thought he could be pushing thirty and I was only
After that I opened up a bit more and was less guarded with my feelings and we made plans to meet up in person for the second time we met when I was at an wedding
So we told our parents about our relationship and that was kind of the beginning
He officially asked me to be his girlfriend on our first date while he visited me at college over the labor day weekend
And yeah I said yes haha
It not enjoyable for us either if we know you do actually want to do it

Maybe they can be mine
My folks asked me to watch their large creepy some YO house over spring break during college
Literally everyone in town knows when they are gone because they own a small business
This house is already creepy as shit and on the very edge of town surrounded by a few hundred acres of dense Forrest
We have had many in the past
Anyways with all of that background info going through my head I was completely alone while doing this
First night was fucking horrible
I had never really had super bad sleep paralysis before but this is for sure what kicked it off because I still often have it happen
I remember having a hard time finally getting to sleep but around I would guess anywhere from AM my eyes shot open wide awake and I couldn t move at all
The room was not entirely dark but I looked to the farthest corner adjacent to the door and I could see something standing there or what I thought was someone standing there
They were very and gangly it appeared as though it was a hooded person facing the corner of the room
The last strange feature I remember is what looked like a black fog or smoke was emanating from the being
I started panicking and hyperventilating because no matter how hard I tried I could not move even if it was for the effort for of trying to save my own life
I had a shotgun really close because I was so anxious to guard my parents home alone and I wanted to be ready
After what felt like around minutes or so of panicking like crazy I just blacked out to sleep all of the sudden
I remember waking up a few hours later still pretty early around ish screaming because I continued to have some vague nightmare after the paralysis
Every other month or so I have a similar encounter and it s very strange but I sort of know when it happens and what to do
It happens more when I am overly stressed for a few days
When it happens now I just breath as hard and as loud as I possibly can to get my body to wake up
When I finally shake out of it I sit up for a bit and go get a drink of water then I am fine
The first time my girlfriend experienced seeing this happen was a rough introduction to her
I forgot to mention it and she saw me freaking the fuck out in the middle of the night and she couldn t wake me up
Now she knows when I do it she just forces me to sit up and I wake up just fine
She pushed me down a hill
I painted a pot and planted a bean in it
It so stupid people who do realize with a tax of thirty cents is cheaper than just pricing it as such will get a bunch of products they think are cheaper

The first and most important feature of lucid dreaming IMO is that you know you are dreaming
It not just a vague notion you know it BIG TIME and I even had dreams where I going around to people and telling them I know this is a dream so I can do whatever I want and then proceed to do something wild
In almost every case there was zero reaction on their part
as if flying in the air in a grocery store was a boring everyday thing
It really felt great because for me it was a breakthrough
I had been reading up on lucid dreaming for months and using all the techniques but nothing was happening
My first lucid dream felt so great but it did last very long
The connection between your conscious and subconscious gets so large that you fall into consciousness really fast and the dream disappears
So the trick for me at least is to keep dreaming somehow to stay in that state
Very difficult
I think the best way I could say I did it was to just keep going with the flow of the dream whatever was happening do try to be logical about it because there really is much logic in dreams
If you riding a purple dragon and shooting flaming arrows at clouds just work with it
Act like it something you always done
If you start to freak out about it you wake up instantly
The next dream was much better I was lucid for the entire length of a normal dream How to measure this
I have no idea seemed like a normal length for one of my dreams
How can this be quantified
The best thing to do is keep a dream journal and write them down IMMEDIATELY after waking up
Do put it off because a lot of information gets lost if you do
And then read as many of them as you can before going to sleep
That sparks your subconscious memory and gets it warmed up
I did this for about months before I started lucid dreaming
There are tons of books on the subject
I sort of got out of doing it when I hit my but for about two years I was obsessed with doing it
It really quite a fun thing to do
Money
I been financially ahead of the curve I guess for all my adult life until recently
Now that I broke life has been radically different absolutely extraordinary how almost every part of one life changes with money

I realized only later that I had been wearing the same top all three of those nights

Got a cold call for a job interview to discuss a business proposal
They guy said I was personally recommended from someone else but would say who
I assumed it was due to a few temp agencies that I had submitted my resume to a few months prior
I showed up at the address he gave which was in a business park
Upon entering I saw a large group of schlubs just like me who got duped into showing up
They gave us a dog and pony show about going into business for yourself selling prepaid long distance debit cards late
To show how the income would be distributed they brought out a pyramid chart but told us it was a Christmas tree because it had a stick on the base
Then after a minute pep talk they split us into teams with a moderator to get our personal information and a check for the fee
I got up immediately and walked out even as the main guy called me out in front of the room asking where I was going in such a hurry
I told him I have better places to be
And that was that
I actually came here to say because I knew the first comment would be up by now

You need drawing pencils
They do have erasers as you supposed to have a an eraser on its own
Also pencils have different gradients some pencils are super light so they are used for guidelines then you use thicker lead to create different effects and drawings that are more permanent
After that you use a pen for inking if you get really fancy
If you just starting get a cheap set of drawing pencils but with a decent eraser
If you get really good move on to more hardcore equipment
leaving it only

I had gotten to be close friends with a girl I worked with at an ad agency

My boss didn t know because I didn t want to tell him until I knew what my plan was and what it meant for me and my future
I got my acceptance letter and text her other friends saying I got accepted
The next day I lost my job because my boss magically found out about nursing school and didn t want to keep me on knowing I didn t intend to stay a part of the team

How can that be true when she just blatantly admitted to finding taller men more attractive
It still part of the equation
There nothing wrong with it I just find it frustrating that they can not admit the fact that they find shorter men to be more ugly
My illness it started with a really bad pain in my side just under my right ribs I went to the Doc he said it was probably nothing gave me painkillers and off I went by Sunday that was at I couldnt take it any more and went to A E got to the counter and just stood there weeping for five minutes before I could talk anywhoo infected gall bladder spent three weeks in hosp had a couple of procedures got a lot of morphine and intravenous antibiotics told I would get an op date soon went home two days later I got a terrible pain just under my breastbone it was agony went back to A E suddenly my temperature shot up to C was shivering and puking got taken to ICU given treatment I cant remember what I was pretty out of it by that time I did ask the nurse if she though I was going to die she said probably not if they can get my temperature down
The next day I am on a ward my temperature is only degrees C by this time I get a ultrasound and they find a large pocket of bile leaked into my body which had kind of cordoned it off somehow so I get a drain put in two litres of bile get extracted and I am in hosp for another month get sent home then I go yellow back to hosp got a gall stone stuck in a duct have to get that taken out infection returns another month in hosp three MRI scans an ERCP almost daily ultrasounds antibiotics morphine etc etc I finally get a date which is only nine days away go home to wait by this time I am a wreck
Nine days later I am in the surgical unit for the op a while later I wake up to pain almost too bad to bear it was a bit more complex than they thought my gall bladder was a mushy mess full of stones and stuck to my liver which had to be cut to remove it all the scar starts between my boobs and goes inches across my body morphine ensues thank god recover fairly well and go home after two weeks then the post anesthetic depression hits jesus christ it was bad didnt move for literally days the would was really painful anything touching my skin or anywhere near was agony for about six months no infection though got through it finally went back to work

Tiny metal shards I was working on a building
Learning maths is very easy
But he
One of my who was by nature extremely high strung had jury duty a few years ago
She took her job as a juror VERY seriously as she should
It ended up being a murder case and the defendant was found guilty
A week or so after the case finished a story came out in the local paper that some of the jurors felt bullied into their verdict
My coworker let s call her B was really insulted and defensive that no one was bullied
This was
So my other call him G and I decided it would be funny to play an April Fools joke on her
Let me preface this by saying although B is very high strung and serious I actually really like her a lot and consider her a good friend
Anyway we decided to write a letter from our local courthouse to B explaining that there were some complaints that she was bullying other jurors
The letter continued that she would need to attend hours of a Juror Conduct and Behavior course
Furthermore the classes would be in the middle of the day for two months during our busiest time of the year
Before I continue this letter although beautifully drafted if I do say so myself had many clues that this was not a real letter
The case number was a form of April Fools in numbers and letters the contact information was all my phone number we addressed it to our work address and it was APRIL FOOLS DAY
Moving on
G decided we should have our mailroom stamp the envelope as received to really sell it and we placed the envelope in her office
She came back from lunch and closed her door and we waited for her to come storming out of the office yelling or complaining about her absurdity
minutes goes by and nothing
minutes goes by and nothing
After minutes I couldn t take it any more and was going to walk in to prompt her to open it
As I got closer to her door I could hear sobbing
I burst open the door saying it s a prank
It s not real And there s B mascara running phone to her ear with her fianc� yelling on the other line letter on the table google open to jury behavior school and me a complete asshole
She was confused and it took a while for me to get her to fully understand that it was a joke
Her fianc� had called a lawyer already asking for advice
Her parents were up in arms she called her mom in front of me to tell her her friend pranked her for April Fools and her mom yelled that s not a very good friend I think our friendship took a bit of a breather after that but she came back around eventually and actually asked me for a copy of the letter recently to show someone so alls well that ends well but I felt like a horrible human being
This was long
Sorry
I don t know if I would classify it as full blown stalking but when I was I got my first job at chain store
I ended up seeing a guy call him C I thought was cute and told one of my
Apparently he thought I was cute too and asked me to lunch
It was an awkward lunch but we got to know each other he turned out to be and had been homeschooled his whole life he was really into showtime mainly RENT and he was going to a local community college
I didn t feel an immediate connection he was a little much for me but we continued to talk via text and at work
After a week I knew it wasn t going to go anywhere
He was really overbearing and religious but also super sexual and forward
Once he asked me to go on a date in the parking lot after work
He didn t have a car but I did so he made me a mix CD and he wanted me to play it on my stereo so we could dance in the parking lot together
The last straw came when he slipped me a note to meet him in the produce fridge
When I got to the fridge he grabbed my arms at the elbows and pinned me to the wall and whispered he was going to fuck me until I saw As soon as I panicked he stopped and was completely normal
Being young and naive I just asked one of my other friends at work a guy to be with me when I told C I wasn t interested
We sat at a table and I remember this next part SO vividly
I had a Frappuccino and I was anxious so it was tight in my right hand
I told C that I just wanted to be friends and he looked at me like a puppy when you speak to it in a high pitches voice head cocked to the side
All of a sudden under the table C s hand was on my upper thigh squeezing really tight
I was shocked and threw my Frappuccino at him really quite comical now
C did not take the break up well
At first he was furious then sad then he started getting really weird
For starters he proposed
I worked at a little restaurant in the store and he walked right up behind the counter while a guest was there and got down on one knee with a ring
I started hiding from him only working in the back of the kitchen switching with a coworker when I knew he would be working etc
One day there was a napkin by the register with my name on it
When I opened it my address was written inside
At this point I was really scared so I finally told the security guard at the store
He immediately fought me to management to explain what was happening and the guy got fired
Security walked me to my car every night for the next few weeks they made me hold my key out like a knife to punch a perpetrator in the throat if need be lol
I never saw or heard from C again
Looking back I can t believe I didn t want to tattle on him earlier and that he never tried to contact me again
My parents didn t even know until just a few years ago

This is the first time ever I read a dilemma like yours and I don t know if I would be able to look at the person in the eye after that

I hate it when these astrology girls try to bring gender in it and claim that anyone who does believe in astrology is a misogynist
I myself am a lesbian who sick to death of seeing astrology stuff all over Tinder
I seen too many girls whose entire bios are their signs
I saw one girl who looked cute enough with some creative photos and had a few interests in common with me then at the bottom of her bio she said If you a Leo SWIPE LEFT
I not even a Leo but I am NOT about to mess with that level of astrology koolaid
She probably try to cast a hex on me or something

But this time was just so strange I was watching someone couldn t tell what they looked like just a black human form sleep on the floor next to my bed it looked like THEY had sleep paralysis but I couldn t move at all
Then their eyes opened and turned red they got up and walked to me and started eating me through my stomach
It felt real
Since we are allowing dead actors I would love to remake The Big Red One and have Lee Marvin as the human

I worked as a bank teller and the morning of April fools I let my younger coworker catch me sneaking a little oz whiskey container into my coffee
I pretended to slur my words and act really energetic with our clients he was relatively new and had no idea what to do as I was the one training him
It was actually just water and vanilla so my coffee tasted great
I let him in on the joke at the end of the day
Worked like a charm

I reckon the plot is nothing without actors who can actually pull it off
Otherwise the porn quality acting will just pull you out of any immersion that the plot might have given you
Perhaps the actors could try improve every now and then

I looked at the door for a quick second but there was none then looked back at him and he was in the same position but his eyes and mouth was like times wider
I never even saw the movie but i saw stills and i did even find him scary but in that moment he looked kinda terrifying

Shard Volley is quite good I frequently play a couple and it strong against Death Shadow in particular 
If you choose to cut down on Helices you may want rest of the Helices in your sideboard 
Certainly 
I would play a Bolt without four Pushes but I like it as the card over 
Fatal Push does kill players so I think there will always be justification to play a Bolt 
I like the Hydras in the board and am wondering if you could go even further with a transformational plan 
Whirler Confiscation Coup and especially Cub come to mind 
Cub could even make the maindeck but it appears to be a pretty tight package and I do know what I would cut for it 
Very cool deck overall I am always interested when Delver has game in Standard 
Holding your Valakuts is completely fine and it OK to play them out into Crumble if you need to 
Crumble sees very little play anyway so do bother with Riftsweeper 
The best part by far is Draw a card 
Feels so good https 
People sometimes play Wild Defiance I think this card is better 
Definitely not a inclusion 
You could consider Sanctuary for an Infect deck 
It similar to Wild Defiance but Fatal Push has picked up quite a bit and having the cheaper effect is obviously good 
This is very 
I looking into Maverick on my quest for a Legacy deck that I can play and enjoy for a long time and a lot of your points on approaches to your matchups and such are very useful 
You likely be better off with a more stock decklist 
Do play Blightning or Gonti Machinations 
Ca say much for the gameplay but I do like to look at the badass legendary spirits and read the stories behind them 
I do think this is good 
Finding the kill is not a problem beating pressure while digging is the problem 
This card is very slow 
The default is to lead with Elf on the play and Hierarch on the draw but obviously the decision is contextual 
If your opponent is playing a deck you should be playing for a longer game and trying to protect your infect guy 
If you really are sure play Hierarch 
When you Path you will be fetching your Temple Garden untapped anyway 
Gaining effectively two life at the cost of actual manabase difficulty in other situations is not worth it 
What nice about Legacy is that basically any reasonable combination of staples is a fine deck to play especially if you have Brainstorms 
It tough to go wrong so long as you play your deck well 
People sometimes play in Pile and Stoneblade decks 
It was more popular to do so a few months ago though 
A decent starting point might be Ryoichi Tamada deck with Opts instead of Probes 
Oh it always been time to break out those Cryptic Commands 
I start with four and see where it takes me 
Notably this opens me up to more spells because of the change from Anticipate to Opt 
Then another Spell Pierce their turn play 
Scapeshift has a unique situation that makes Serum Visions awkward all of the ramp spells force you to sandbag it or not get full value from the card 
Opt scries before the draw which avoids that problem 
I tried Sleight in the past but I would like to leave up Cryptic mana and still be able to do something else 
People already play Counsel this card allowing you an extra mana or missed land drop to work with could be worth seeing fewer cards 
It fine to do so against removal decks especially if you also are playing Eidolon 
Most decks have more removal than counterspells so you can try to pressure your opponent that way 
Four of everything in the maindeck that become more or less the norm of late 
I prefer Witchbane Orb 
It good against Burn and better than Crumble in the mirror 
I would bring in Crumble against Eldrazi Tron anyway and Gx Tron is an OK matchup that also is played very much 
Ideally you will whittle your opponent down to or so and set up a situation where you can cast two spells on their end step then untap and cast two more 
This helps you play through counterspells as they will only have one untap phase to deal with all of your stuff 
This is hard to do through discard and gets even harder if your hand is very clunky with spells 
I generally will attack with my creatures if the opponent does not have a Shadow in play and once they play one I hope to chump block or force a removal spell ideally from a Watery Grave 
Your opponent wo always have a Shadow so you can be more aggressive 
If you are interested in building your deck to be better against Shadow cut down on two mana spells 
Play Shard Volleys and a Lavamancer or two over the quadlazer maindecks everyone seems to be on these days 
For sideboarding I want to take all four Blazes out first 
They are conditional Lightning Strikes 
Skullcrack is also Lightning Strike but depending on how many good cards you have you can leave some in 
Those are the worst cards in the maindeck in my experience 
If there was a one mana enchantment with exalted and nothing else it would be much much worse than Birds of Paradise for an Infect deck 
This goes to say that Hierarch is in the deck primarily to accelerate you and the exalted bonus is just gravy 
If you think you play Infect for a while go with Birds until you able to upgrade 
Did you consider playing Shard Volley over Eidolon 
I think that card is a lot better enables more turn and makes turn kills consistent and I have really had problems with four Volleys and lands 
I definitely wo play games with this deck but I hope you win all of your matches for the rest of time 
This deck is dope 
I think you want Omens though 
Basically every other card is much better with an Omen in play 
I do think Stroke is worth putting in your sideboard 
It strong against Titanshift and Eldrazi Tron of course 
I think that Counterflux serves a similar role and possibly does so better 
Besides the two decks above you can consider Counterflux against Death Shadow though its clunkiness might hold it back here 
Counterflux is another good spell against Storm stopping Blood Moon and midgame Empty the Warrens in particular 
It good against various midrange decks Abzan Bant Eldrazi etc 
It good in as well since very few people play Remand in these decks nowadays 
I think the extra mana is worthwhile given the additional applications 
Any split is fine the cards have different drawbacks and benefits 
Just make sure you have room for a Chameleon Colossus 
This depends on what version of the deck you are playing 
If you have Hour of Promise fewer Prismatic Omens and more stuff like Relic and sweepers in your main you have some more sideboard space for strong hate cards against those decks 
Roast is good against Eldrazi Tron 
Thragtusk and other fatties are reasonable as well but there is much else in the way of great SB cards 
Thankfully this matchup is fairly easy 
Nature Claim should already be in your sideboard as an answer to Blood Moon and it good against Affinity as well 
I think that your should have at least four sweepers between Anger and Explosives and I usually play additional dedicated hate cards be they Grudge or Shatterstorm or whatever 
Do play Reclamation Sage I find that I never want to Pact for it and having the inefficient answer against Affinity is poor 
Burn is a tough matchup for you either make sure your board is for it or ignore the matchup altogether 
Obstinate Command are awesome and Bolts are great too 
Hope this was helpful 
For reference here the sideboard I working with Anger EE Relic Witchbane Orb Nature Claim Baloth Primal Command Shatterstorm Chameleon Colossus 
Note that I playing four Hour Omen main with Bolts and a Roast over the standard Khalni Heart Expeditions 
I been on Witchbane Orb over Crumble I find it to be stronger in the mirror 
Orb is serviceable against Burn and randomly hoses some niche strategies as well 
Regular Tron is not super popular and regardless I think the Hour of Promise version is to beat it making Crumble less necessary 
I am not interested in Crumble against Eldrazi Tron 
Checklands are optimal you keep a fair amount of so you need every land untapped always 
Fastlands are a better choice 
Additionally all of your lands need to tap for red because all of your spells are red and you will frequently cast three in a turn 
Do cut Searing Blaze 
This is your best card in all of the unfavored matchups and lets you slow your opponent racing clock while also pushing your creatures through 
It is bad in some matchups but you be crazy to cut them entirely 
I think UW Control is very strong against both decks if you build your deck well for the Titanshift matchup as most people have with Seas and Tec 

I like Runed Halo quite a bit 
Burn is alright against both decks 
You could also just play Titanshift with Roasts and good hate for the mirror or the Hour of Promise version 
I ca speak to the first I have played a game with Sleight of Hand 
I do think is strong enough for Grixis simply because you do have enough creatures to consistently get value out of it 
I think it a very strong inclusion in Jund however since that deck is all creatures and plays much lower to the ground than Grixis in general 
I have two and Kommands in my Jund list currently along with a blue splash for sideboard cards 
Dreadbore is a metagame call so if you think it will be useful play it 
Going bigger than the DS player with value engines is a good way to win and Dreadbore is a solid answer to that strategy 
Your own LotV is another removal spell that also does work against some other decks 
Regarding your current decklist It looks reasonable to me 
I highly recommend Staticaster in the board that card is awesome 
I think you could use an extra sweeper as well be it Anger 
The way BtL is constructed currently it just is a strong deck 
Remand is weak Cryptic is alright but several decks make it look foolish and the general clunkiness of the deck make it rather unsuitable to Modern as it stands 
Titanshift is very good since it threatens turn kills while also having a long game 
Never keep four lands 
That an actual hard and fast rule even if you are a new player 
Even if you have your Rest in Peace against the Dredge player or something similar 
I will not keep on the play unless they have multiple creatures 
Having multiple guys lets you get a little bit of damage in and force your opponent to spend their time killing them which buys you a bit of time to find the second land 
On the draw I think you can keep most 
The deck is particularly there a reason you wo find any blue Scapeshift decks at the top tables in tournaments 
It pretty slow not proactive enough to win games if its interaction does match up properly and Remand is pretty weak right now 
That said if you enjoy it keep playing it 
You can improve a lot through practice 
At least your opponents can never complain about flooding 
Some sort of instant that lets you basically Impulse twice 
I wish they would print that card 
Joking aside I do think any new cards are necessary 
The tools available are good it a matter of putting them together in the right combination and playing against a favorable metagame 
Your turn play should almost always be Eidolon 
Situations where it is not the right play are those where the damage you deal yourself will actually matter your opponent has a fast start that can pressure you you need to kill a mana creature more urgently or you know your opponent has a removal spell and you want to make their mana situation awkward 
There are others but these are the most common for me 
Assuming your list is close to stock the sideboard plan should be something like Searing Blaze Skullcrack Path Palm Firecraft 
I made it a priority with my own list to ensure I have enough good cards against Shadow to take all of the Blazes and Cracks out after game 
Molten Rain is just not where you want to be the matchup hinges around spells and trying to put the opponent in awkward positions 
I played against a deck featuring Modern Treacherous and Sundial of the Infinite 
In a word powerful 
Todd explained his SB plan in a winner interview and Sam wrote an article about Eldrazi Tron on CFB 
What has Ballista done for you against Shadow that makes you hesitant to take it out 
It good when you have Tron and have died to their board but if that the case then your sideboard cards are also good and have applications as well that Ballista does not 
One more strong cheap spell 
Infect strength is predicated on maneuvering around your opponent interaction and having enough ways to do that is important 
Fatal Push and the banning of Probe both hurt Infect because it allowed opponents to interact at the same mana efficiency as Infect which did happen much before and also took away a tool Infect had for doing that 
Your plan in these matchups is simply to race 
Cast your ramp spells Titan on turn and that should be good enough in most games 
If Gx Tron in particular is giving you trouble sideboard a couple of Crumble to Dust 
These can also give you the edge in mirror matches 
I been happy with the Mardu list just spend enough time making sure your sideboard plan is strong and the deck should carry you 
I think you might not like it because it fairly different from normal Burn but I think it to the metagame 
People just are ready for six spells on the first three turns backed up by a good sideboard 
Also it worth considering that your primary goal is to the tournament 
Playing a very stock RW list might get you two match losses simply due to being a known quantity and drawing average while the Mardu deck has a better shot at turn your opponents all the way to the RPTQ 
That said playing the deck you feel the most comfortable playing is never a bad decision 
Cut the Nacatls from Naya and play that if it suits you best 
Your list looks reasonable I not huge on any of the spells or Guerilla Tactics but if they worked well for you then ignore my nonsense 
You should look into the Mardu deck that did well in a recent Modern Challenge it essentially cuts Helix for Bump in the Night and Eidolon for the full set of Shard Volleys along with Grim Lavamancer and Burst Lightning 
The goal is to kill on turn as frequently as possible which is facilitated by a ton of spells 
People have been doing well online and at PPTQs with it as well it has a better Shadow matchup than the standard RW version 
You can play Barbarian Ring in Legacy that much better 
It a Titan that you can cast on turn and ensures Scapeshift on the following turn or frequently with a Titan 
Never a bad topdeck in games that you can win 
The downside of course is that it very clunky 
I do know if Bolts are the right cut for Hour 
You can sideboard into a couple of Atarka Commands if you are particularly worried about lifegain 
Life Goes On is a rather narrow card so do expect to play against it much at all 
The same goes for Oketra Last Mercy 
Aven Reedstalker is a crucial addition to my Boldwyr Intimidator deck finally I can cut those Nephalia Seakites 
Mardu has a higher density of spells as it more or less boils down to Bump in the Night Atarka Command extra Lightning 
This leads to fewer awkward draws with several spells but makes your deck worse at racing and in the mirror 
Atarka Command also provides goldfish speed and is the best card you have against Collective Brutality 
This card has the single highest potential damage output in common situations 
For example if you have two creatures then Command deals at least 
The card performs even better if you have Nacatls 
RW is slower than the others but takes less damage and usually has four Helices 
It best against other aggressive decks and still retains Destructive Revelry in the board without having to find a third color in game 
It also better against things like Spreading Seas and can safely play four Inspiring Vantage 
Gainsay is Andrew Cuneo he plays Infect in Legacy as well 
The best card that does require warping your deck severely is Roast 
If you have a fourth color BtL for your sweeper and play some Thragtusks or even additional wraths 
I think white for Supreme Verdict is the way to go 
It always costs lands you have 
You will either lose the mana from those lands this turn or next turn 
I do think Gaea Revenge is very good in the first place but I think that card is stronger than Carnage Tyrant 
Haste is terrific 
If you in the market for a fatty I recommend Inferno Titan Thragtusk Primal Command maybe Tireless Tracker 
Roast Thragtusk Relic of Progenitus especially Jund EE mostly Jund and Into the Roil are all good cards against Shadow 
The stock version is Nexus Tropical Island Pendelhaven Forest fetches split the green fetches flex lands 
You might be able to cut a Trop if you are playing Swords in your sideboard 
As for the flex slots do get too cute 
Wasteland Dryad Arbor Karakas Bojuka Bog Tower of the Magistrate are all reasonable with the first two being the most likely to make your deck 
Engineered Explosives is good against the green versions but Grixis is tougher 
Roast is excellent Chameleon Colossus is terrific only dies to Liliana if they even have it 
Roast is reasonable even though it sometimes ca hit Shadows since that means they are at or less and your Valakuts can kill them 
Boarding in Crumble represents a misunderstanding of what the matchup is about 
Eldrazi Tron is more commonly a midrange deck against you attempting to pressure with creatures rather than assemble Tron and cast big spells 
I assume you have Damnation somewhere that is your best tool by a lot 
Make sure you can answer a TKS and you will be fine 
They have one card that Leyline interacts with please do board those in 
Zach Koch started GP Vegas in Legacy with Infect 
You could try getting into the Legacy version as you really only have to find Trops and Forces as far as expensive cards go 
I do think you can afford a colorless land in RUG 
If you could I think it should be Desolate Lighthouse instead of this card 
Zach Koch is a really good Infect player I do know of anyone better than he is besides Tom Ross 
He started but lost his last three matches to miss the Top 
I strongly considering this one 
The deck RUG used to support Electrolyze but this card is actually in terms of its function 
If my suite of can afford a spell this seems like a solid option 
Why do a lot of people play Sudden Shock over Searing Blood 
Infect is around anymore 
Definitely try it the card has performed well for me in the past 
Chances are it is just a worse choice than EE or some other cheaper spell that retains versatility 
I do think this is a very good question since it implies some pretty thinking 
It does matter what your opponent is playing when you are making this decision in the dark 
I fine getting Thoughtseized with this hand as your opponent will still have at least threats to deal with 
On principle I would put those cards in your maindeck just to try and win this match 
Titanshift is likely the best deck against Company Sudden Shock and EE are good sideboard cards for this matchup 
I think that if Treasure Cruise were legal you could play four colors 
As is getting Bump and Fatal Push is not worth the cost 
Blue versions of Scapeshift are better against common hate cards than Titanshift in my experience 
For example Titanshift is more or less cold to a backed up Blood Moon or Leyline of Sanctity people play a couple of Nature Claim or some such while blue versions have at least four frequently more answers to them 
Ghost Quarter is pretty easy to play against though admittedly the Titanshift deck does it better 
Fulminator is also fine for BtL as you have counterspells for it as well as the velocity to find your mana 
Blue versions are worse than Titanshift if your opponent resolves Surgical Games 
Both decks are crappy when that happens but Titanshift is more likely to get its Valakuts Extracted while the blue decks will get Scapeshift itself removed so natural killing is more likely if you play BtL 
Monastery Mentor plus blue cards is really tough to build right 
Terrible in the maindeck for sure and I think there are better options in the sideboard 
I sure there more to it than this but four Etched Champions in the main alongside sideboard SGW and Thoughtcast is a lot of meat against the removal decks 
Not many players have this many tools for those matchups especially all four Champions in the first game 
If you are sideboarding it then obviously Anger is better 
If it in your maindeck then I still think that Anger is the better choice 
The exile clause is relevant and games where you are cycling Sweltering Suns are frequently moving slowly and probably in a winning spot for you 
I recommend at least one Into the Roil over a Repeal sometimes you cold to a Tasigur or Eldrazi 
Death Shadow and Affinity are unfavorable matchups for Burn and Eldrazi Tron is OK but has Chalice 
There are a lot of creature decks as well which are frequently tough to beat 
It still a good deck though 
If your opponent is ready you will beat them in and your sideboard cards help quite a bit 
Spreading Seas is another target and Sea Claim is becoming more popular 
Still I agree that it a risky proposition trying to keep them off of you by forcing yourself to fetch Stomping Ground 
There was a recent change on MtGO that allows the combo to operate more quickly as far as I understand 
I highly recommend a blue version of Scapeshift either RUG or BtL 
Four Cryptic Commands should satisfy your need for interaction I think 
Plus really fun to play 
This is very close to my maindeck I have a Roast Anticipate and Electrolyze over Bolt Explore land Charm 
I slowly realized that less than four Anticipate is crazy I highly recommend it 
Your sideboard is very good too I have to return to Wurmcoil and Rejection which I dropped for other cards 
My current SB has a Relic and a Logic Knot both have been quite good for me 
Logic Knot in particular is real good against everybody 
Kudos on beating Ad Nauseam 
That hard as fuck 
Deflecting Palm is better and I do think there are enough cards to take out to add Paths after your Palms and Revelries 
In which matchups do you want it 
I do think any of the abilities are very good at all and she costs a hefty amount of mana if you intend on keeping her around 
Drawing multiple Searing Skullcracking the Finks and Pathing 
Sometimes you just draw a bunch of spells and kill them but usually you need a sideboard card to win 
RUG and BtL both have very good control and midrange matchups as well 
The matchup profiles are more or less the same but being very linear is more useful than a bunch of Remands nowadays 
I think that if one of the two decks loses to hate it RG 
The blue versions have counterspells and can remove weird things with Cryptic or Repeal if need be 
RG has much less recourse 
If Burn is that large a percentage of your metagame playing a few Firewalkers is completely reasonable 
Do this only if you are cutting tools you need for other matchups 
If you do play Firewalker go for a set of Helices and some Deflecting Palms 
Price of Progress and Wasteland are the biggest reasons 
The occasional player has Taiga for Destructive Revelry 
Obligatory Tibalt comment 
I do think so 
It bad on rate and bad when you cycle it 
Too expensive basically 
I really only want to bring in Revelry when I am sure to have a target or my opponent has one particular that destroys me usually Leyline but Dragon Claw or something similar will also merit bringing it in 
I do really like boarding it in just for Spreading Seas especially since you frequently need all of your cards to beat Seas decks and ca afford a dead one 
Diversity is another possible metric 
Misstep obliterates that one 
I think that when you need information about a card CMC Ancestral Vision has a CMC of 
It can be countered when Counterbalance reveals a land for example or targeted by Goblin 
is great for watching matches of certain decks http 
I thinking specifically of decks that would include cards like Seismic Assault or Raven Crime 
Being able to draw actual cards instead of turning your Loams into Charm seems powerful to me 
It remains to be seen if two mana is too expensive for cycling though 
I think it more than a bump for Modern Loam decks 
This is pretty 
I think it technically correct but people really like playing with their Japanese foil Unhinged glazed Islands also 
I think Jund is still a favorable matchup overall just a lot closer than if you were playing Titanshift because you are playing some cards that are bad by themselves in order to be more explosive 
Breach is the best Valakut deck against other combo decks because it can kill on turn and generally goldfishes faster than others 
Because it plays SSG to accelerate into Breach it also gets to play Chalice which is very good in several matchups 
In general it is capable of doing much more broken things at the cost of some consistency and weakness to discard where other Valakut decks are not very weak to discard 
Personally I would prefer Titanshift 
I am a fan of the consistency that it provides 
Seems very odd to me to exclude Fatal Push 
You could stay in Esper and still have plenty of good removal 
Going into red to try and burn opponents out is not worth the hideous mana in my opinion 
There a philosophy with Scapeshift and that is to play as few cards as possible 
Lightning Bolt is pretty bad for this reason and Fatal Push does not differ very much 
Any cards you play should ideally wreck your opponent to be worth the card you spent not assembling the combo 
If you are interested in beating Shadow I highly recommend maindecking or Explosives 
Roast is also reasonable against Shadow especially versions so playing that is also a good choice 
I dislike Push in particular because it makes you fully a deck making your mana even more horrible than it was in regular BtL 
As far as sideboarding definitely do cut any of the win conditions because your plan against decks is to be as live off the top as possible 
For a similar reason I do like having more than effects you need some to stop Liliana but feels like too much 
Essentially keep a Shift in and leave a Negate out 
More on the mana problem I think RUG is a better choice overall 
Clean mana is a huge plus against Burn and such and playing a more fluid game with Anticipate is really nice 
Playing this version with two Repeals and two EE maindeck makes me feel somewhat comfortable with Shadow 
There are a few things Baral does not die to Tarfire Brutality Kommand Electrolyze that make in his favor correct in my mind 
You do really need two Medallion effects in play to win so playing four of the better card to replay if the first one dies is good 
I a bit confused about some of your sideboard choices 
As you noted there are plenty of options available but I think having more of the best cards which to me appear to be EE Fulminator Gideon Extraction is better overall 
I also like to know about your exclusion of Stony Silence 
How do you sideboard for midrange mirrors 
I see nine cards I would like to remove the discard spells but only five or six cards that I am actively happy to bring in 
Lastly I recommend adding Zealous Persecution to your list of alternate options 
That card is incredibly powerful against several decks 
The player could have had a Distended Mindbender which at least makes more sense than having Mind Bend in your Abzan deck 
While suspended Vision is in the exile zone 
Strangler can process it into their graveyard but has to have a creature to target in order to do that 
Sometimes it the only creature on the table 
You can also use it ability on Search for Tomorrow Lotus Bloom and Rift Bolt in a similar fashion 
Searching this sub and and should give you a few good ones like this https 
You can also pick up tidbits of useful information and interesting cards to try from various deck techs 
Ben Stark Extended deck https Dan Jordan short deck guide https Daryl Ayers' GP Richmond deck tech https Ari Lax GP Boston article http 
Ari also had a couple of video series where he played RUG one with Dig and one with a list similar to Jun Young Park iirc 
Daryl Ayers wrote a primer for it that I ca find but perhaps you can 
Adam Yurchick wrote about Jun Young Park deck here http 
Gabe won a PTQ with almost exactly this deck in and wrote a tournament report about it http that has some cool stories and valuable information in it 
I dislike his exclusion of Snapcasters they are the best cantrip in my mind 
Less than four is pretty crazy to me as well 
I like most of the rest of his maindeck choices 
As far as building RUG not BtL Scapeshift goes I have a couple of simple rules Play at least cantrips make sure you can sideboard out all your bad cards in each matchup 
I would say there are about cards I have locked into my maindeck and SB cards with the rest being flex slots that suit different metagames 
Hopefully GCB makes the Top I like more people to see RUG doing well 
Your sideboard can be tuned to your liking 
Personally I think the following slots should be in your for sure Obstinate Baloth Nature Claim Crumble to Dust Engineered Explosives Anger of the Gods depending on how many you have in the main I want total Thragtusk 
EE may seem like a weird choice but I think having another tool against aggressive decks is good 
It stock has gone down of course but I still like it 
Beyond that it your choice 
Additional threats Primal Command Tracker Inferno Titan more removal spells Sudden Shock Ancient Grudge Shatterstorm and random hate Relic Melira among other things are all reasonable options 
As far as the metagame goes TitanShift is very well positioned 
You have a great matchup against and a tuned maindeck and good sideboard will make your Affinity and Burn matchups comfortable as well 
If you interested in playing closer to Twin I definitely recommend cutting the BtLs and playing RUG 
You tap out less and get more flexibility with your cantrips 
Well Boil is certainly an option 
You kind of have my blessing 
I am very happy playing RUG against blue decks much more so than TitanShift or BtL 
You have fewer clunky sorceries and replace them with cantrips that put blue opponents in a hard spot 
I can share my current list if you interested 
EDIT Current list is here http 
I definitely want at least cantrips this has since you ca play too many and still have enough cards to win with 
SB is pretty stock I think the flex slots are Thragtusk Negate Grudge Roast Shatterstorm 
If you move sweepers to the maindeck those slots could open up as well 
I agree with your opponent 
If he does have another discard spell then you have at worst a turn five Titan and he ca possibly win the game before then 
Taking the Titan leaves you with no real action and you do have to draw something to win 
This gives your opponent more time to develop his threats etc 
I prefer Dreadship Reef 
You never really need Urborg to get two black mana and being able to build the resources you need with just one card against a Liliana or something similar is great given how popular are 
It also just excellent against blue decks of course 
July When all was right in the world 
Warping Wail and Spellskite plus whatever is in the color you splashing are a reasonable plan 
Part of it was Tom Ross' win with GW Tron which made a lot of people want to try it 
It also just performs well against Dredge and with a plan against Infect 
Spirits is doing anything particularly powerful if you just play the creatures 
You need something to help against Jund and to have a chance against people who can kill quickly by just putting a lot of beef into play 
I go for CoCo 
Usually people go for additional ramp instead of Oath in this deck 
A stock version might be Oath KHE Farseek Anger Scapeshift with some tweaks to the manabase as well 
Do board differently 
If your opponent has Thoughtseize Surgical early whatever 
Hopefully you can stop it if they draw the card later on though 
Keeping Fulminators away from your Valakuts is the best you can do 
I not super worried otherwise since you can beat Surgical on a shockland 
Given that the best thing you can be casting afterwards is usually a ramp spell or cantrip I do think it worth it 
I rather make sure everything is dead since that more important 
If your Damnation actually kills everything you have the time you need to play the card you would have cast for free later on anyway 
Yeah come on guys 
Your Dredge hate card is allowed to be good against me 
Play something else 
The nerve of some people 
I recommend watching deck techs there are too many and they all provide some kind of useful information about BtL specifically or blue Scapeshift in general 
Look for Daryl Ayers Jeff Hoogland Ari Lax and Lukas Blohon 
Three white sources is safest in my experience sometimes having Temple Garden instead of a Flooded Grove bites you though 
You could play Scapeshifts but at that point BtL gets less useful as it really only two additional copies of Shift 
It makes it harder to justify playing four colors and a bunch of clunky spells 
You want to maximize the advantage BtL gives you against Jund and the like 
Do maindeck Madcap Experiment 
It is a decent sideboard option but I dislike straying from the main gameplan 
Titanshift plays more fetchlands and more ramp in general making KHE more consistent 
Cryptic versions play at an overall slower pace as far as ramping goes 
It not always clear when playing a ramp spell or leaving up a counterspell is right but my general rule of thumb is to cast your spell unless there is something very backbreaking your opponent could do 
For example leaving up Remand is better when your Tron opponent is threatening Karn but not when their best play is Collected Company because you can deal with it later 
It all about weighing proactivity against your opponent scariest play 
I really like Worldly Counsel 
You have to play some number of cantrips to keep up your velocity as this is an card combo deck and ca always afford to just spew off spells that do progress towards your kill 
From your list I would go for Angel Cultivate at least one Bolt for Hunting Wilds at least one Izzet Charm I like and consider Electrolyze and Worldly Counsel 
Consider Engineered Explosives and Chalice of the Void for your sideboard as well as a Nature State since you can have five copies of it vs 
Blood Moon 
Summary Dismissal would be better I think 
We did play Voidslime and being castable off of does make the case for this card in my mind 
I think your plan should be to just kill them before Ulamog if at all possible or hope to dodge it 
They only have and World Breakers so I do think it worth playing a bad card over something as versatile and efficient as Negate 
Jund is the posterchild for the strategy you describing 
It does do a lot of but it plays very similarly to Shardless in that you are trying to grind your opponent out of resources 
Abzan could be better for your interests as it plays a bit better in long games thanks to Lingering Souls 
I would recommend Abzan Company or Chord to you as those decks use cards like Eternal Witness and Reveillark and Kitchen Finks to grind people out 
However they also play infinite combos that you dislike 
I have not played with Nissa but I tried Monastery Siege and found it very mediocre 
If you are interested in more protection spells Spellskite and Pierce are much better because they are cheaper and more versatile 
If you just chump block the Master with one of your Hierarchs your opponent can deal you at most damage if they have a Galvanic Blast 
Doing so lets you kill on your following turn with Vines backup 
No matter what your opponent does with his one mana you have a way to protect your Nexus and Hierarch to win next turn 
The only differences between the lists are Brimaz Kitchen Finks versus Eldrazi Displacer Selfless Spirit Thalia Guardian of Thraben 
To answer your question I like the version with Finks because the card is fairly 
I curious about some of your card choices 
Kytheon seems suboptimal to me I think there are better you could be playing if you need more which I am not sure you do 
I go for maxing out on Dryad Militant or possibly playing Judge Familiar 
Less than four Flickerwisps feels crazy same with Thalia 
In general I think the deck would benefit from streamlining the and into and of just the most consistent and powerful cards 
Cards to try Thalia Heretic Cathar Aven Mindcensor Burrenton SB Mirran Crusader SB 
Your numbers are accurate for the most part 
Ad Nauseam can kill on turn with turn Pentad Prism and a Spirit Guide 
If you are shooting for the absolute nuttiest of nut draws then keep in mind that Affinity and Dredge can both win on turn 
Finkel recommends playing four Canals in this article http 
I would consider cutting one Flooded Grove for a Cascade Bluffs as you are boarding into Angers and have more Valakuts than other lists 
I have no idea how Daryl got away with four Groves and four Valakuts 
As far as the spells I like having access to at least one MD now 
There are too many decks that roll over to a sweeper to not have in the main 
My cut would be at least one Bolt 
Besides that trimming an Explore for a Snapcaster is reasonable if you want one 
I never liked Nature Claim in the SB I think it a waste of space 
But I understand that it necessary in some metagames 
I love the Fogs I had a couple in my list and they have been very very good 
I highly recommend copies of Darkness in your sideboard it is very good against Infect Affinity and Suicide Zoo 
Hurkyl Recall is better against Affinity and Skite is probably better against Infect but not much else is very good against Death Shadow and having a very versatile card is good 
As for metagame positioning Ad Nauseam is a lot better than people give it credit for 
It is favored against so many decks but is held back by an unwinnable Infect matchup and a bad Suicide Zoo matchup 
If you are optimistic about dodging Infect it can be a very good choice 
Serum Visions and cheap counterspells are good but I do like weakening the manabase just to splash them in the Titanshift deck 
You get a lot of mileage out of being able to fetch basics without missing a beat on casting spells 
I do think Deprive should be in the same deck as Cruel Ultimatum Damnation Kalitas and Cryptic Command 
I would go for a Countersquall or a Dispel depending on how often you can leave two mana up versus one and whether or not Dispel does enough in the matchups you expect to face 
It is hard if you know the trick that wins you the game 
If you do know the trick it can be difficult to discover what it is 
It certainly alright to fit copies of Rest in Peace in your sideboard for some extra help against Dredge 
My cut would be the third Palm but that decision is based on whether Dredge or Become Rage is more common 
Yep Park list could play lands because he had the full cantrips 
My list has this one has so feels more appropriate 
Boarding in Claim against Burn is fine 
It really hard to beat an Eidolon and you do want to be casting Dismember 
Tom Ross recommended bringing it in in a couple of his sideboarding guides and I do think there been a reason for that to change 
I played straight RUG for about two years 
I like a lot of what this deck is doing 
I hate playing Bolts but you have to now given the prevalence of aggressive decks 
The cantrip package is the exact same as my own though I do like the second Electrolyze over Sudden Shock 
I think Charms is too many though I think you can get away with two and maindeck an Anger 
The most interesting choice to me when I looked at the list a week ago was the Fogs in the board 
I tried them out and found them to be very powerful doing unique things that traditionally better spells could not do 
Edit I think is the sweet spot for mana sources 
That usually means lands Search STE Farseek if you want it 
This list is at which is a bit shaky 
I would trust my luck with just lands without Visions or Sleight of Hand 
I think I was more excited about Dark Confidant 
Dark Confidant is awesome 
Some Modern decks play Murderous Cut and Slaughter Pact and Whisper would frequently be better than both with this upgrade 
Will it vanish when the world needs it most 
Username does not exactly check out 
While I will always love RUG Scapeshift more than the other decks Titanshift is very very good 
I play it over Breach because the sacrifice of turn of average speed and the occasional turn kill is worth the resiliency and increased threat density 
Darn I was totally wondering how you were going to turn on Pyromancer Ascension while going nuts with Paradoxical Outcome 
Do you think this deck is stronger than the Fatestitcher version of Ascendancy 
I think the main draw to it is Thoughtcast but you have to make a big sacrifice in your deck construction to play it 
Through the Breach versions are usually the ones playing Scapeshifts in the 
Decks without Breach always have four Titans and four Scapeshifts 
I do think Arbor is worth having in your maindeck 
Certainly play one in your sideboard but I do think having the surprise is worth awkwardness in your opening hand 
In a general sense more decks are healthy for the game 
They help ensure that the player with a stronger understanding of their deck and the boardstate will win more often 
There are certainly situations against Freeze Mage where there is nothing you can do to stop them from winning the game but there are others where understanding their options and playing accordingly will win you a game that a less experienced player might lose 
Also its OK to have a few games here and there where you just get run over 
There would be no incentive to play a combo deck in any card game for that matter if it did have the potential to win a game in an unfair or degenerate way 
They make sacrifices in the form of consistency and resiliency and introduce another way to think about the game 
Repeal is excellent but is really at its worst in the Bant Eldrazi matchup 
Against Burn Affinity and Zoo it really powerful 
I probably just use lands in my limited decks if you try to play Unlimited lands you might flood more often 
You cast three Goblin Guides on the first two turns once 
It was awesome 
Wild Defiance is awesome against both decks 
Spellskite is also pretty good 
Would Toxic Deluge not be a better choice 
Might as well kill their Thalia and Revoker too while you at it 
I suppose life total would be a concern but I do usually find life to be a crippling cost against D T 
Yep 
Four copies 
It an excellent upgrade for the deck 
You can cut down on Shivan Reefs and fetchlands and take less damage 
That will only happen after you drawn all of your fetchable lands 
That means you have probably more lands in play which is more than you ever need 
That extra fetch was going to help you anyway 
The main wonky point is your manabase 
The deck is so I recommend cutting your four fetchlands for Misty Rainforest 
Blood Crypt is bad because it does cast green spells or Cryptic Command can just be the fourth Stomping Ground 
Flooded Grove could be an Overgrown Tomb if you find your black mana difficult to get after making the above changes 
Lots of people do like Visions in their deck 
Usually you see a couple of Worldly Counsel or Anticipate try those out and see if you like them 
The important part is not being messed up by your shuffle effects 
Yuuki Ichikawa won a tournament in Japan with Esper Mentor last year his list http might be a good starting point 
There are a lot of Standard decks even just within sets that are significantly more powerful than the best Modern decks 
Affinity and Omnidoor Thragfire come to mind 
Not Omnidoor Thragfire 
But man is that deck sweet 
Academy more or less reads If you would discard a card instead skip your next draw step 
I do think that very worthwhile to have when you can just board in Leylines 
If it free to play a colorless land by all means go for it 
That just one list that performed well 
I think that the occasional situation where Path is better than Dismember is not worth the damage to the manabase and Geist in the sideboard is not impactful enough 
People have had success with Geist in the past but Kitchen Finks seems like a better choices given that it also helps more against Burn 
Mishra Bauble Miracles 
Rolls off the tongue nicely 
Any advice on the Paladin matchups as Midrange Shaman 
I been having difficulty pressuring them enough to where Tirion or Ragnaros are good enough to swing the game in their favor 
Seems like their tools pair very well against my gameplan 
But everything flying so I feel like the Forest would help 
Gold 
Ragnaros puts your opponent in a tough spot as the deck does have very good answers to that card and it threatens to significantly weaken Ice Block 
With about one in five players casting Aetherworks Marvel and another sizable chunk casting Copters and Cruisers I think it a very good call 
Just needed one 

The only way to consistently win this matchup is to include Antonidas or Malygos possibly both as otherwise you just wo have enough damage to win 
I recommend against doing this though as it only helps that matchup and hurts all the others 
I agree 
Then maybe cut the other one for an Injured Blademaster since the Bishops are good with that 
After that cut the Doomsayers for Totem Golems Shadow Word Deaths for Feral Spirits Entombs for Thunder Bluff Valiants 
I do even know why you put Power Word Glory in your Midrange Shaman deck 
Rookie mistake 
I do think four is the right number 
It a good card but drawing multiples when you rather have either more power or more versatility is awkward 
I been happy with cutting Blessing I had Spellskite and Sylvan Scrying from my maindeck 
I still do 
It hard to beat aggro decks and maintain the advantage against other things since you have more dead cards in midrange or combo matchups 
The deck is still solid however 
If you are already play on 
Costs you zero dollars and you can slowly save for a deck in paper while you continue refining it and becoming proficient in playing it 
To provide a different answer than other people RG Breach 
Very few decisions to make with that deck but it very powerful 
First time I heard that 
I think Hearthstone still has a long way to go before it becomes as complete and intricate a game as Magic 
Mana consistency is nice 
However and I say this every time the topic comes up mana does happen as often in Magic as people make it out to be 
We just very good at remembering those times and forgetting others 
Ad Nauseam is a solid deck 
Figure out what you expect people to play tune your sideboard accordingly and make people pay for not preparing for you 
In general it to pick up a deck cold for a tournament 
Shadowstep Steward of Darkshire value 
The most important thing to note is that you are virtually guaranteed to play against Affinity in a Modern tournament of reasonable size while Tron is not as certain 
If you think you can make appreciable improvements to more popular matchups by conceding a less popular one then it worthwhile 
The first cuts should be Remand 
They are terrible 
Bolts are next then Izzet Charms 
Electrolyze is excellent 
Your whole gameplan is to get seven lands in play as quickly as possible and have as many live draws as possible when they inevitably get you hellbent 
This is incredibly similar to the technique I use when building decks for both Hearthstone and Magic 
You articulated it well 
Nice work 
One thing I do is look at successful decklists not to base my specific card choices off of but to get a sense for how many cards I need to fulfill a certain role 
I might be deciding between a second Mana Tide Totem and an Acidic Swamp Ooze and look at a decklist that plays Totems but makes concessions to Doomhammer in other areas 
Since my choices were different I might have to play Ooze in order to have enough tools to win the matchup consistently 
I have had success with a streamlined list it more or less the same as Standard versions but without Loot Hoarder Ice Lance Bloodmage Thalnos Doomsayer Frostbolt Mad Scientist Novice Engineer Arcane Intellect Acolyte of Pain Forgotten Torch Frost Nova Ice Barrier Ice Block Fireball Blizzard Emperor Thaurissan Alexstrasza Pyroblast 
Kommand is pretty bad against Tron 
They usually wo play their eggs without the mana to activate them so the card is doing much for you 
Electrolyze does the relevant jobs better 
I have a lot of experience playing Scapeshift here are some thoughts I have on matchups though not necessarily a sideboard guide those are dumb With BtL all your sideboard cards are better 
You have more free slots because playing one Crumble or Shatterstorm gives you access to five copies of the card 
This also means in general that you have less sideboarding to do for any given matchup 
I think it very important to know how many of your cards are bad in a given matchup 
For example I make very sure to have exactly eight cards to bring in against Infect since your bad cards are Remand and Cryptic and every other card is good 
Affinity usually merits SB cards since Remand is your only bad card and you can trim a Cryptic or two 
Building a fluid sideboard is very important 
Against aggressive decks look to cut down on clunky cards and interact efficiently 
The specific cards that are good vary from deck to deck for example Dispel is good against Suicide Zoo but not necessarily Bushwhacker Zoo but the key is to slow them down enough to kill on turn 
I know you mentioned that you are happy with the list but I highly recommend making sure that you are overboarding in any given matchup 
Also try Engineered Explosives and Chalice of the Void lots of people myself included have been liking Chalice and EE is a sideboard staple for this deck that is generally excellent 
The most notable thing is your manabase it really weird 
BtL decks have the same lands with one flex slot and you included some strange choices 
Most people also have Kodama Wilds maindeck and a couple Electrolyze but there is a justification for playing Bolts over Lyzes 
Presumably you not interested in splashing green but keep that option in mind 
Most Burn players have Atarka Command in the main and get Destructive Revelry in the sideboard off the splash 
I think Rest in Peace should be your graveyard hate of choice 
Cards that do deal your opponent damage should be totally worth the cost of drawing them 
Relic cycles but it clunky and Dredge can beat it more easily than RiP 
Given that you only have lands it might be right to go up to or and move a Searing Blaze to the sideboard 
Keep that in mind when thinking about your numbers in the board 
It good for board states where Lightning Storm is not good enough for some reason 
This could be large amounts of life something like Leyline of Sanctity whatever 
I think the main reason is to have an out against Abzan Company 
If you do have Meliras and such to kill there no reason to maindeck a Dismember 
More flex slots to you 
I never liked discard spells in my builds of Grixis Control except for a couple Thoughtseizes in the sideboard against combo decks 
I play something similar to Corey Burkhart version notably adding Ancestral Vision and Cryptic Command to the deck 
Cut the discard add an Angler or two move Kalitas to the board and you good to go 
It important to note that the tier system is mostly arbitrary 
Calling one deck better than another purely based on a higher winrate is also not entirely foolproof as that single number does account for a player potentially different approaches to each matchup 
You are correct that Reynad is underselling how Hunter is against other decks 
I still say the Call of the Wild nerf was defensible as it was making Hunter decks dangerously homogenous 
I own four Magic cards 
They are all Scalding Tarns 
Long story 
The honk in India means this I about to do something that might kill you watch out 
Relevant http 
Blood Moon is very good against Bant Eldrazi so Jund Moon or Temur Moon might be good decks to try 
I would advise against straight UR since it lacks good answers to the creatures that might hit before you land Blood Moon 
Jund has Terminates and Lilianas while Temur has Goyfs to block 
As a Scapeshift player the UWx decks I fear most are those that can slam a Geist on turn and ride it to victory 
It forces me to either hope you do have it or keep in Angers to deal with it as otherwise it difficult to race when backed up with counterspells 
Generally I am very happy to see this sort of deck on the other side of the table but Geist swings that around 
Four Primeval Titans no question 
You are playing Summoner Pact as extra Titans so it does make much sense to play less than the full four in the first place 
Beyond that your list is fine 
Most people prefer some number of Windswept Heaths over a couple of basics 
Oliver Tiu deck from Worlds had Forest Mountain Heath and also cut a KHE 
The sideboard is also decent 
I recommend trying a couple Chalice of the Void as it is very good in your bad matchups 
Nature Claim and Ancient Grudge help out your Affinity matchup though you could also just play Shatterstorms 
I highly recommend giving Primal Command a go it been great for me so far 
We do even know who would win in a fight between Stangg and a Stangg Twin token 
Scapeshift brethren gon na Cool to see my favorite deck do so well 
I like the matchups against GBx random Steam Vents decks and Voice of Resurgence decks 
Unless the Burn player was dead on the following turn 
Even then I still hold it in hopes of my opponent activating Tasigur or tapping mana for something else 
Welcome to reddit 
We hope you enjoy your stay 
Step Punctuation 
I suggest Jeskai Nahiri if you enjoy playing control 
It the best control deck in the format though it does struggle a bit with Eldrazi and big mana decks 
I liked playing Oil Rogue can we have that back please 
I asking nicely 
I always played RUG I confident it the best version and I love how it plays 
The key is to play Lightning Bolts 
Since we do need good cards against aggro right now I have two Angers in the main and Explosives in my sideboard 
My list is very similar to the one you posted so I just share my differences in the main and SB 
Main Flooded Grove Bolt Telling Time Farseek Cascade Bluffs Anger Anticipate Into the Roil A couple of small upgrades besides Bolt Anger Telling Time is just worse than Anticipate and the ramp spell is excess in my experience 
Into the Roil is Repeal but good against Eldrazi and Tron 
SB Grudge Anger Back to Nature Corrosion Dispel Cage Shatterstorm EE Thragtusk Negate Chalice of the Void Relic of Progenitus Roast Relic is obviously great against Dredge but also does serious work against Jund more live draws buys time against Goyfs and various random decks 
Chalice is a very recent addition that I thought was great to combat Infect better than Sudden Shock or some other card would 
Chalice also totally shuts down Suicide Zoo and Ad Nauseam both very difficult matchups and random combo matchups 
This is a choice I took from BtL lists such as Patrick Dickmann that use it to beat fast decks that do fall to BtL Anger 
The Roast is the card in the main that was moved to my SB you could move it back if you wanted 
I curious about your exclusion of Snapcaster Mage over Pia and Kiran 
I think one of the problems with this deck is having too much clunk in the form of and sorceries and Pia and Kiran just adds to that issue whereas Snapcaster lets you play more fluidly 
Especially given the cheap cantrips Snap is nice to have IMO 
I generally play RUG but if I had to play BtL your list is about two cards off of what I would play in the 
Congratulations on your finish 
This one in particular fucked me up 
That right Dovin Bann 
Owner of the Ghirapur DovinDome 
Collective Brutality has made both Disfigure and Duress significantly less popular than they were before 
Spell Quell 
What makes certain cards more powerful in Sealed than in Draft 
I do Limited much 
That only damage on turn 
Nice try buddy 
Every games is still a huge exaggeration even if you are playing competitively 
You are grossly overestimating how often mana screw occurs 
Elves is sort of a beatdown deck but usually uses a combo to win the game 
The Legacy version of Goblins is a reasonable deck but is necessarily as aggressive as it is in Modern 
Burn is also a viable strategy if you into that 
Brandon deck is more Nacatl Burn than Zoo 
Appreciably fewer creatures and more Lava Spikes to keep their interaction on the wrong axis 
One reason may be that Orzhov Charm additional versatility is worth the extra mana not to mention that it can kill opposing Dark Confidants and such 
I do agree with assessment however 
Your deck is totally fine 
It important to have four Searing Blazes in your so I probably cut the Shard Volley and have all four in the maindeck 
I think Dragon Claw should be Kor Firewalker because if you want to beat the mirror you might as well play the best possible card for it 
Anger seems like a nice card to have but actually drawing it is frequently awkward and I suggest you try Searing Blood or more Helices instead 
Also on the Podcasts app 
One deck can only play so many but now many decks can play one of these cards and make a Storm player tournament miserable 
Grand Greeks 
Blasphemous Act and Dragonstorm should be the pitches of choice as they can be found with Peer Through Depths 
Jund other midrange decks that like to kill stuff 
The goal with Ranger is to push through their removal spells 
If you interested in RUG I have a solid list that should do well against the metagame 
In general though I would recommend playing Scapeshift right now 
Looks like you took a lot of elements of the Legacy RUG Delver decks specifically the and Nimble Mongoose port in Gnarlwood Dryad 
Neat 
The answer highly depends on how you built each of your decks and the specific aggro decks you expect to play against 
My instinct is to choose GW Hatebears or as those have less painful manabases and a gameplan that is against Burn 
Make sure you have adequate Rest in Peace and Stony Silence in the sideboard regardless of what you play 
Right I think the deck wants more Helices or possibly maindeck Timely Reinforcements like the Jeskai Nahiri decks have 
I think having access to both Dark Confidant and an Emrakul kill is worth taking losses to Minus Fifteen in a long tournament 
I do think the deck could use additional ways to gain life to offset Bob Thoughtseize and a painful manabase 
Grixis Delver decks regularly have four Ancestral Vision in the sideboard to swap out for the Delvers in attrition matchups 
Cryptic Command gets worse in most matchups postboard 
I usually cut Cryptics in blue mirrors because those games are all about the cheap counters especially Dispel 
It fine against Jund but frequently I find that you are just trying to slam Nahiri and ride it to victory 
Their discard also makes it hard to have it be really strong 
Cryptic is good against Tron so playing one seems OK 
Kitchen Finks have also become staples in Jund sideboards 
Just awesome against so many different decks 
Lots of people are cutting their Cryptics in favor of more cheap spells one more Visions in your case and stock lists will also have lands and frequently Electrolyze 
You should have room for the Purge and Explosives 
Counterflux is amazing against the three popular decks you cited I definitely include at least one 
Negate is OK too but less strong against Jund 
What made the decision for you to maindeck the Verdict over Anger 
I see BtL players waffle between these two I prefer Anger as it easier to hardcast and does force you to get your fourth color avoiding some pain or awkwardness 
Sacrificing some value against Jund and Eldrazi stinks but Anger is much stronger against Dredge and Burn 
Same 
I judge people for tapping their creatures when blocking 
Relic of Progenitus is the 
You can bring it in against almost any Snapcaster or Tarmogoyf deck making your Dredge hate slots useful in plenty of other matchups 
Generally the RUG gameplan is more fluid 
You play appreciably less lands BtL usually has RUG has at most and usually and have access to cheap cantrips rather than clunky sorceries 
I do know enough about BtL sideboarding to understand which deck midranges better postboard 
Jeskai Nahiri is generally favored against any sort of aggressive deck as the entire deck is built to kill stuff to protect your win condition 
Delver can be better against grindier decks because of Kolaghan Command but you also got tools against aggro in the form of fast 
Travis Woo casually plays a totally stock deck and Top a GP 
Cockatrice is a pretty good goldfishing tool 
After that paper is probably next best 
Jund is generally favorable for you 
The way you describe it your Jund Guy will be bringing a bunch of hate cards like Leyline of the Void Grafdigger Cage and Nihil Spellbomb 
Try some Nature Claims and Engineered Explosives for the creatures 
Tap all creatures your opponents control does target 
They can cast Pyretic Ritual Desperate Ritual Ascension Ritual Ritual turn the ascension on then Manamorphose into some cantrips and they off to the races 
I think I lost on turn once before 
I think it so important to have a ramp spell that shaving them is wrong 
Ramp is what lets the deck get ahead of people 
Your explanation of your opponent Martyr deck clears up some sideboarding stuff 
If they got a bunch of Rangers and Spectral Processions and other clunky stuff Remand to your heart content 
I disagree with some of your sideboarding decisions 
Martyr Proc I do think it ever right to cut a Tribe Elder 
Cutting Scapeshift is maybe defensible 
I really think you want some creatures out of the sideboard probably cutting all the Remands because your main plan may not be enough without some additional pressure 
Bant Eldrazi Wurmcoil Engine Titan and Baloth are all great in this matchup 
Anger is usually fine 
Remand is awful and should be the first four cards you take out IMO 
Grixis Delver Remand and Cryptic are pretty bad 
Not sure why you cutting ramp spells they are necessary to making your game plan work 
Roast has been good for me against Eldrazi it perfectly handles all of their important threats 
For a midrange metagame I cut the Lightning Bolts 
Play an extra Anger and more cantrips 
Lightning Bolt is usually underwhelming against midrange decks because it a bad topdeck and is not that flexible 
From the side your singular Fulminator Mage is not accomplishing much 
You really need multiple without the additional cost of Eternal Witness or Chord to slow big mana decks down appreciably 
Almost every blue version of Scapeshift plays exactly mountains Steam Vents Stomping Ground Cinder Glade Mountain 
Your opponent almost certainly made a mistake by not knowing what he had left in his deck because you usually can kill your opponent even if you drawn of your mountains 
As for why the reason we play is because it enough to win through Salt on a shockland while not making the mana too awkward 
Fun and not to mention interactive 

Nahiri is not better than Jace 
Not even close 

I not sure if Kalitas is better than Bloodbraid but I lean towards no 
Bloodbraid into anything except a discard spell or sometimes Lightning Bolt is better than Kalitas and Kalitas needs more to go right to contribute significantly to a board state 
If BBE were unbanned people would play four of that and zero Kalitas in a heartbeat 
Regardless Jund does need help 
People do play Serum Visions properly and therefore have a reduced perception of the card 
I agree it worse overall than other options but not by as much as one would think 
Sleight of Hand is slightly better if you interested in a cantrip 
I prefer Anticipate to any other option because it is the most versatile and flexible 
I like having a couple of Peers because they are better topdecks against midrange decks and frequently are better postboard when you have cards like Shatterstorm and Anger to find 
Worldly Counsel is strictly for BtL decks 
Four Engineered Explosives 
Your budget is totally serviceable 
Merfolk Dredge Living End Ad Nauseam and Eldrazi Taxes fit it well so it a matter of choosing which one fits your playstyle best 
The Tier decks in Modern according to ModernNexus are Jund Infect Affinity Jeskai Tron Burn Merfolk and Abzan Company 
A Punishing Fire unbanning would render at least and up to of those decks essentially unplayable and would make the best deck oppressively powerful 
No thanks 
Jace does fit into the possible to see a return category 
The metagame would not be healthy with the Mind Sculptor in the format 
Same deal with Bloodbraid though it less egregious 
I think mountains is plenty 
Maybe the deck wants more but certainly not the OP is playing 
This deck feels too on Reclamation in my opinion 
Having the regular Dredge gameplan of recurring Amalgams and Bloodghasts may be useful as a backup if your opponent stops Splendid Reclamation 
Here a rough list Faithless Looting Splendid Reclamation Life from the Loam Mystic Retrieval Insolent Neonate Golgari Stinkweed Imp Prized Amalgam Bloodghast Narcomoeba Wooded Foothills Stomping Ground Mountain Valakut the Molten Pinnacle Blood Crypt Dakmor Salvage Boseiju Who Shelters All I cut the excess lands and Tormenting Voices from your list to add the creatures 
This list differs from stock Dredge by cutting Tormenting Voices and Conflagrates for the combo pieces 
I was thinking of that Conflux deck which is super awesome but now I have discovered a cool new deck 
Here comes dat boi 
When you replicate Gigadrowse additional copies are put on the stack 
Remanding the original Gigadrowse the one that was not created by replicate returns it to your hand 
You still get all the other copies to resolve and tap their permanents 
You a combo deck looking to delay your opponent while digging for necessary pieces 
See Scapeshift and Twin decks for similar reasoning 
Being comfortable with tournament play is very important 
Staying mentally prepared for each of your rounds maintaining focus etc 
Find larger events PPTQs IQs etc 
to play in so that you develop a feel for playing a large number of rounds 
White is better against aggro decks with Timely Reinforcements Path if you want it Stony Silence etc 
Black is better against midrange decks because of cards like Maelstorm Pulse and Olivia and also has access to Slaughter Games for combo matchups 
These are really nice 
Lots of people do like versions of cards but I think they awesome 
Beware clich ahead 
Play what you know 
If you do have a lot of experience with any deck play Jund 
Jund great 
Another good option is Suicide Zoo which is very powerful and harder to hate out than Dredge 
Best possible day to get the Tavern Brawl quest 

This guy onto something 
THAN of his creatures survive Lightning Bolt 
Pretty much every dredge deck nowadays is within cards of Zen Takahashi decklist http or is the Bridge from Below version that won the SCG Classic recently 
The extra point of power is not worth losing two very relevant abilities for the decks that would play Smiter 
Thoctar is just not better than the other creatures Zoo decks want to play 
Burn has favorable matchups against Suicide Zoo and Dredge and Jund is a that historically slightly in your favor 
You have to play four Rune Snag for it to be consistently better than Mana Leak and playing four of this kind of spell is just not where you want to be 
Additionally Rune Snag and Snapcaster Mage do not work well together 
Remember that Infect and Affinity overlap on Inkmoth Nexus 
Teams also have to keep in mind that fetchlands overlap assuming this works the same way Unified Standard does so even though two decks might not share the same spells they could still be unplayable together 
Fuck 
I was curious why people played either Advocate Languish Gideon Languish or Advocate Gideon but never all three 
Zach went ahead and did it and the deck is very powerful 
I ca help but think it wants some Read the Bones to bridge Advocate and Gideon but I imagine Liliana and Ruinous Path do a good job of that as well 
I got a couple questions on sideboarding 
I not much of a Merfolk player so it fully possible my questions come from a lack of understanding of the deck 
I interested in why you did sideboard at all against Burn 
Are Chalice and Negate perfect for this matchup 
Dismember seems very meh and there probably a third card to take out as well trim a Master of Waves 
How good is Chalice against Jeskai 
I understand that their cheap removal is crucial but my general philosophy with creature decks against is to be as as possible postboard so I want the Reejereys 
Finally I like to know about your testing process 
Your deck and play seem to be very well and I interested in how you got there 
Thanks and congratulations on your performance 
Spellskite is the best card in the matchup but some other strong choices against Infect include Chalice of the Void Ghirapur Aether Grid Thoughtseize Whipflare Spell Denial Blood Moon and Gut Shot 
Maxing out on Galvanic Blast in the maindeck helps a lot as well 
Generally your strategy should be to race as quickly as possible while not leaving yourself open to an explosive kill 
This means leaving mana open for interaction unless you feel that going for it is your best bet to win and deploying hate cards as quickly as you can 
I think Todd wanted more tools against slower decks 
Nissa helps stave off Goyfs and Death Shadows does a similar job to Pendelhaven for pushing some extra damage and is randomly awesome with Kitchen Finks 
I not sure I willing to invest mana into this sort of effect but it certainly interesting 
It really hard to fit graveyard hate into sideboards honestly 
It hard enough preparing for the most popular decks 
Grafdigger Cage does a good job of doubling up as Reanimator and CoCo hate but other than that you really ca waste slots on stuff no one has played in months 
Now we have to have a plan against Dredge 
People do really play that much graveyard hate in paper yet 
Dredge has been slowly growing in popularity for a while so it may be the time to do that 
To be clear you should be playing Temple Garden even if you have Wild Nacatl in your deck 
Lands that do tap for red are not worth your time 
Temple Garden and Windswept Heath are very bad 
I recommend playing an extra Sacred Foundry and four red fetchlands in their place if you can 
Pillar of Flame should likely just be a damage spell or Grim Lavamancer 
If you prefer more cheap spells Shard Volley is fine 
You could also maindeck a Skullcrack or two 
I curious about how Bedlam Reveler has played for you 
How close to Treasure Cruise is it 
How often does it rot in your hand 
The deck played so many Finks because Finks is a very good card rather than being a combo piece I think 
Towards the end Abzan Pod decks did even have a combo in them see Lantto GP Milan winning decklist 
If anything I think Pod played a better midrange game because Birthing Pod was so much better at that than Chord of Calling 
Maybe I just ignorant but I never understood why Kiki Chord decks choose to play cards in the main where Pod decks rarely went above with the same number of if not more tutors 
What makes Chord different 
I usually a fan of Nacatl but right now Jund popularity and the saturation of creature decks is pushing me away from playing it 
Those decks have a harder time interacting with spells than creatures so trade your Nacatls for some Skullcracks and Lightning Helices 
I learning to play Affinity well 
I been losing a lot with Scapeshift lately so something new is a pleasant experience 
Consider this What makes the Jeskai deck better than Burn 
It seems to be pursuing the same game plan with less focus and an attempt at interaction 
You ca it and your package of cantrips and removal wo hold up against midrange decks 
The Esper deck is just not a good shell for Delver 
It grinds worse than Grixis and the key to being successful with Delver is being flexible and mana efficient 
Lingering Souls and the other Esper options do not do this well 
I would recommend building the Jeskai deck to be more linear closer to Burn but making the most of your Delvers with a full set of Leaks and other cheap counterspells 
Max out on Bolt Helix and Path to get your guys through 
Birds is your best bet but be aware that Hierarch is about as important to Infect as Goblin Guide is to Burn 
Do play this deck if you do have Inkmoth Nexus 
If you looking for cards against Burn and other aggro decks there are better options than Offshoot and this card 
Baloth sweepers etc 
are all better choices 
Where would you slot this card in 
It too to occupy a sideboard slot and I would cut any of my ramp spells for it in the maindeck 
The flying creatures are your best bet to win and having a bunch of Galvanic Blasts in the maindeck is a big help for removing creatures or finishing them off 
Sometimes the random Jund deck will play a Sword in the sideboard take Andrew Boswell Jund from GP Boston a couple years ago and some Faeries players will have a Sword or two in the sideboard 
The only playable swords in Modern are Cranial Plating and Batterskull 
And if I am familiar with the subreddit simulator 
Yo listen up here a combo 
You playing four colors and are trying to cast four and five mana spells on and ahead of curve 
Hitting your first four land drops is crucial so you should play lands 
Lightning Bolt is by far the best removal spell 
Besides that Jeskai tends to be the best at answering creatures larger than as they have access to Path and Snapcaster Mage 
What interesting is that Mardu midrange decks like Paul Rietzl have been choosing Path over Terminate where one might think that Terminate would be better in a deck so similar to Jund 
In fact Mardu has access to every single good removal spell outside of Decay and people still play Path 
Path being cheapest is the sole reason which says a lot about how much efficiency matters in Modern 
If I do draw well and my opponents topdeck well they can easily overpower me That the way it is with everything though 
You seem to have found the negative sides of these decks without much of the positives 
All of these decks lose to certain things but what important is finding a comfort level with the deck core strategy 

Stomping Ground casts both halves of Ancient Grudge which lets you fetch Island more often and take less damage against Affinity 

Stomping Ground makes casting Twin easier and frequently you had to do it ASAP because of the speed of Affinity 
Breeding Pool often made you get Mountain or untapped Steam Vents which are awkward and painful respectively 
Forgot about Slaughter Games I was only thinking of stuff that people play with any frequency 
Crumble is generally harder to resolve than Blood Moon against us and we can win through it anyway 
Blue decks with Blood Moon are rough 
Given the prevalence of creature decks I go for Jeskai Nahiri 
Tune your list to have game against Company and the mirror 
Bogles might be hard but there are cards that wipe the floor with them 
Wurmcoil Engine is excellent at buying time against Jund 
You may already be overdoing it on the creature part of the sideboard so I not sure if the extra grindy card is necessary 
Snapcaster should be coming out against aggro decks 
Postboard you are bringing in Angers and cheap removal 
Usually Remand and Cryptic are worse than Snaps against aggro 
I recommend playing the matchup a bunch and finding what works for you 
It very hard to just theorize a sideboard plan without playing games 
Just do something and your plan 
As far as specifics casting Explore on turn seems unexciting to me 
Engineered Explosives is very good against a lot of aggro decks especially Zoo 
It is less good against Burn but very powerful against every other deck 
I always play at least one and I recommend you try it 
Bolts is fine to kill Bobs and slow the Liliana clock 
Remand is an awful topdeck and you want to minimize those as much as possible 
Tron games are all about stopping their threats until you can kill them 
Tapping out of Cryptic mana for a does help you and their stuff outclasses Baloth easily 
Again playing games is important 
Figure out if your other removal spells slow the creatures down enough for Sudden Shock to be good 
I think it better than the last two Remands and the Dispels 
Scapeshift 
Blood Moon 
Thankfully no one is playing it 
Here my attempt to you on Scapeshift You can play a version with Gifts Ungiven and it feels remarkably like DigShift 
Toss in tons of sideboard options and incredible resiliency to all manner of hate and you got a sweet deck 
PM me for a list if you interested or I can post it here 
Regardless of what you choose I wait until the middle of the month for the banlist update to be released 
Though it unlikely anything will be banned this time around WotC has a history of banning entire decks out from under people 
Infect probably the closest to a ban 
Remand is boarded out quite a bit 
In fact the only decks you listed where I do take all four out are Burn and Jeskai 
I frequently have all four Remands in against Burn especially on the play as you are trying to buy time to Baloths and Electrolyze is worse in the matchup 
When building your board you ca just throw in a bunch of cards that are good vs various decks and call it a day 
You need to think about what actively bad in your matchups and have and not more than cards to bring in 
In case it helps here are my thoughts on how to approach sideboarding for the decks you listed Infect You want to interact as cheaply as possible 
Their plan against you is predicated on threats counterspells and protection 
Cryptic Command can be good but usually is not and the same is true of Remand 
Dispel Claim Negate Sudden Shock Anger and Staticaster are all good 
I think you have two extra cards for this matchup 
Jund You are trying to put as many lands as possible into play and have as many live topdecks as possible to kill them or buy another turn 
Baloth and Surrak are strong and Negate is defensible 
I want more cards in the board for this matchup as I like to cut all the Bolts Remands and the Anger 
As is Remand and Anger are the first five to go 
Affinity This is fairly obvious kill their stuff 
Claim Sudden Shock Anger and Staticaster are solid Baloth is very bad 
I tend to like Cryptic in this matchup but since we need three more cuts after Remand I can see trimming on those 
Burn This depends quite a bit on mostly because of Remand 
Dispel Negate Sudden Shock and Baloth are always good 
Cryptic is poor and I cut some number of Omens because the card does do much in the matchup and they can bring in Revelries 
Jeskai Nahiri I do like Baloth in this particular matchup though I do against the previous pure control versions as your advantage is having a bunch of clunk and stuff 
Dispel Negate and Surrak are the only cards I bring in cutting all the removal save for a Bolt 
I generally like to cut Cryptics against these decks as the postboard games are dominated by Dispel and Remand 
Abzan Company Dispel Sudden Shock and Anger 
Remand is poor because of their Voices and I trim a Farseek and an Explore past that because they are superfluous 
I 
I got nothing 
The default manabase that people play for BtL is something like this Steam Vents Stomping Ground Valakut the Molten Pinnacle Cinder Glade Mountain Breeding Pool Misty Rainforest Forest Island Flooded Grove Watery Fountain If you want the third source the best cut is Flooded Grove 
The only other cuttable lands are Breeding Pool and Misty Rainforest which are better than the Grove 
Revolutionary Pariah 
Well 
Has anyone 
The argument that almost everyone makes that Visions is bad because your ramp messes with it does hold water if you are playing the card correctly 
Do cast it after suspending Search on turn or if you plan on sacrificing 
It possible to get the value out of the card while still maximizing your ramp 
Into the Roil was fine against turn Titan specifically now I think having Repeal is better 
Roast might be worth playing one copy of 
I would say that my playstyle is that similar 
BtL versions usually have mana sources I play with sometimes 
The cantrips let you play at instant speed much better than BtL does 
As for Lumbering Falls I not trying to win with it 
It there to chump block and I found it better than the Temple I would play instead 
Regarding sideboarding This is where I feel a lot of people sell RUG short 
Lots of players have stuff like Nature Claim and Spellskite that are somewhat unexciting 
I prefer to make the most of the mana we have access to 
I do think Pulse is necessarily better 
If you worried about losing to Burn or Zoo Kitchen Finks does just fine 
Two mana is miles better than three especially in this deck 
Grapple is somewhat similar to Sylvan Scrying in its utility and you do care much about life against the grindy decks you want Grapple for 
I do like the Omen version overall but my main problem is that you have to play mana 
The average RUG Omen deck is playing cards that do nothing but make mana in addition to four Explores 
I do know if it defensible to play Bolts in such an list seems like you become too dependent on having Omen 
I could be totally with these thoughts though 
Let us know what your testing tells you 
I suggesting playing as many cantrips as possible and cutting 
Electrolyze is good because your interaction also helps you find the eight pieces of cardboard needed to win but are generally unexciting 
Bolt is not what you want against Jund 
Those games turn into topdeck affairs very quickly so your plan should be to get as many lands into play as possible and rip a Scapeshift 
Liliana is usually the only card that matters 
Bolt is also irrelevant against Tron and Jeskai finding a target good and the only times you really miss it are against Zoo and Infect 
I found that Charms and Lyzes and Repeals and do enough to get the game to Cryptic territory against other aggressive decks 
That said Infect and Zooicide are popular now so I am playing two Bolts in the main 
As for my list the specifics frequently change but a lot of cards stay the same 
Here the core mana sources Usually lands ramp spells Farseek being the but recently I been liking lands as you do want to hit your land drop with a spell 
Notable manabase inclusions are Cascade Bluffs makes SB Angers less awkward and Lumbering Falls one could also try Temples or Desolate Lighthouse 
Cryptic Command Remand Snapcaster Mage Scapeshift These will never change in this version of the deck 
is the perfect number of Snaps on the others are 
Electrolyze Izzet Charm Repeal I like to start with these for my package of cheap 
Electrolyze is really good Charm is necessary as a fifth Remand and is very versatile and Repeal is simply very powerful 
Past that I usually go for additional cantrips Anticipate Peer Visions and interaction as needed 
Roast Spell Snare maybe a sweeper Mana Leak whatever 
I try to minimize as much as possible 
My sideboard tends to be pretty normal but it worth noting that I a big fan of Explosives Shatterstorm and mana creatures 
You want your sideboard cards to be really powerful just like any in the main needs to really pull its weight to be worth detracting from the primary gameplan 
I played RUG for about two years never switched to any other variant 
It by far the most consistent in everything except finding a kill but not behind by that much 
The main thing people are doing wrong with this version is playing Lightning Bolt though it is necessary sometimes 
I remember Grave Titan being a beating for Jund players last summer when Grixis was very popular 
Random Kalitas synergy is nice 
There is no rule of thumb with Explosives 
Get it down quickly if you expect discard spells even if your opponent can guarantee it only trades 
Against aggressive decks do be greedy and jam it when it is the best use of your mana 
Being aware of the common creatures in each matchup is important as well 
Nearly all Jund creatures cost Etched Champion should make you consider setting EE to etc 
In the way of tricks Thalia Guardian of Thraben does affect your Explosives 
Since the counters depend on sunburst you can declare X so it costs and pay two different colors of mana to get an EE for with only mana 
I would advise against Miracles mainly because the deck requires significant knowledge of the format beforehand and you probably wo have much fun playing it 
If you worried about getting bored playing a deck do be 
There a lot more depth than at first glance and you will always come across weird situations and opportunities to be creative with your deck construction and the games themselves 
Pick a Storm deck any Storm deck 
Dark Depths Creature 
Here the deck tech Kibler did at Worlds years https 
Obstinate Baloth is usually too slow against Affinity out of my Scapeshift sideboard and I do think that very different here 
Consider Decay Charm and possibly Fulminator Mage instead 
I assume Abzan means Abzan Company and I think you should be very interested in Damnation and the extra Decay 
Merfolk players like to take out Vials against Jund since they are poor topdecks and are fragile so I do think Grudge is very good 
Damnation is very good 
Consider the additional Kommand Pithing Needle and Fulminator Mage against Infect 
Anger is probably better than of your cards so I would keep it in 
Pithing Needle is pretty good against Ad Nauseam as Lab Maniac is harder to win with and they usually do have answers to Needle on Lightning Storm 
I recommend looking more closely at decklists for the matchups you expect to face 
Playtest to find out in the matchup and sideboard so that your gameplan matches up favorably against your opponent plan 
I speaking to the matchups where I feel knowledgeable 
If I off base with any of these let me know 
I think Linvala may be a better option than Dromoka 
She does fall completely flat to a removal spell and is better against the Reflector Mages that lots of other people are playing 
Gerry been playing maindeck Timely Reinforcements for a long time in this deck 
It does a better job generally of protecting Nahiri 
Scapeshift has favorable matchups against Tron and Tokens and if you play a Bring to Light version you have access to an inane number of sweepers against the aggro decks 
Ad Nauseam is but I do think there a deck that beats everything here 
Grixis is the best Delver variant 
You may want to read Caleb Durward articles on the deck as he played it for quite a while 
Ryan Overturf recently did very well at an SCG Open with the deck and his list and primer should be useful resources as well 
The problem with the Jeskai version is that it is more or less a worse Burn deck 
The threats do hold up very well against the midrange decks and sometimes you just do nothing 
Siege Rhino Might see play once Polukranos rotates 
Even if you do know what the metagame is you can expect lots of people to be playing Bolts which are far better against Zoo than Burn 
While Infect is by far the most likely deck to lead with Tropical Island Noble Hierarch you also give your opponent an opportunity to mess up and think you some sort of Maverick or Stoneblade deck especially if you lead on Forest and save your Elf from one removal spell 
That weird as fuck 
Turn you have another rat that a drop Typhoid Rat etc Thoughtseize 
Five Anger of the Gods 
The white decks are a bit better against aggro because of the cards you mentioned but I strongly advise against maindecking any white cards 
Vendilion Clique is your best bet against this deck but it really a horrid matchup 
good insight brian keep it up 
So badass we needed two fights to kill him 
Standard players HATE him 
If you keep anything reasonable Crumble on turn will win the game against Tron 
The common counterargument to this is that they can just play lands and cast stuff before you turn the corner but now you have Emrakul on suspend 
Valakut combo decks have moved away from Scapeshift and especially Cryptic Command making your Crumbles much better against them as well 
Crumble is rather poor against the blue Scapeshift decks because they only play two Valakuts and can win even if you Crumble a shockland 
It much easier to wreck a Through the Breach player 
When I got back into Magic I purchased the New Phyrexia infect starter deck and made some changes 
Nothing like double Blanchwood Armor on a Blighted Agent 
Flusterstorm is totally fine to have one copy of 
As you said cascading into it sucks but my sideboarded copy has won games I had no business winning 
I never forget the first time I saw the words The End and cried 
Show was legendary 
I think it this https 
I cut all of your Abrupt Decays before any of the Bolts 
Forcing some damage through a or Snapcaster is not worth your two mana 
Consider cutting a four mana creature if you got them in the main because as a Scapeshift player I much rather see that then a hate card or multiple faster threats 
I working in the kitchen 
I recommend doing some research 
I had a Surrak in my Scapeshift sideboard at various points to beat Grixis and Twin 
What do you mean by if Scapeshift becomes a thing again 
the first thing to do when you super rich is to a bunch of hearthstone gain life FTFY 
As if Quicken was good enough 
You can make a Scapeshift player sacrifice all of their lands 
I always played RUG without Omen and I feel that it been the best version the whole time 
You get a lot more flexiibility than the other Scapeshift decks in your maindeck choices and the sideboard is better than everything except BtL 
The two most important things are that RUG is most resilient to the most common hate cards and is more consistent as well 
The more RG versions have nut draws that beat everything but fold much harder to certain strategies and ways to punish a linear deck 
BtL has a pretty good alternate gameplan but I never liked the manabase and added clunk 
The reason very few people play Storm is that it does have many favorable matchups among popular decks 
Most decks either goldfish faster or have powerful disruption and a quick clock 
I say Tron is a favorable matchup because you can win through a turn Karn and that their best play against you 
Scapeshift is favorable depending on your opponent build of the deck 
I not sure about your matchup against the decks 
My current list http Not pictured are Vendilion Clique Ancient Grudge Dispel Nature Claim Negate Firespout and Shatterstorm in the sideboard 
Sorry for the awful format 
You may want to consider Sudden Shock for the sideboard as lots of people have been trying that recently to answer Abzan CoCo and Infect 
I prefer to not play Lightning Bolt in the main but you can if you want 
Other considerations are Spell Snare Explore Into the Roil and Compulsive Research 
Serum Visions as well but that a rather different build of the deck 
Just you wait until the Hunter hits for damage on turn 
Alternatively Exile SSG for Faithless Looting discard Griselbrand 
Exile SSG play a land and cast Goryo Vengeance 
Attack for draw 
Fury of the Horde on Griselbrand removing Izzet Charms or something attack again 
Draw more Fury of the Horde again and deal your opponent damage on turn one 
Everyone prepared for Spectacular though they know people tend to overplay the new stuff

Fuck Colin 
Grishoalbrand has a fairly involved win condition and has a great deal of play to it 
It also one of the fastest decks in the format and will demolish unprepared opponents 
I do know much about Hulk Footsteps but it a similarly fast combo deck 
Mostly this 
It helps that Abzan Company and Jund are rather favorable matchups 
Entombing is the ultimate kick in the nuts though 
Classic Priest 
I guess they are Frost Novas 
The that Frodan lost to was the largest I seen 
Multiple Blades of will do that 
Screw those jerks making people put Crumble to Dust in their sideboards 
I not saying the exalted is important 
It just is as valuable as the mana 
Birds of Paradise is the best replacement 
The mana is more important than the exalted though having both is obviously optimal 
Pod decks sometimes played a Goyf or two to hold onto the board against aggressive decks while they set up 
Does seem bad if you play against a lot of Delver and decks 
I thinking World Breaker Mortuary Mire or something to win the mirror 
Super grindy but you get there eventually 
Edit Forgot World Breaker ability requires colorless mana 
Ulamog seems better but some way to get a Mortuary Mire into the bin would be nice so you can go infinite 
Quality shitpost 
It worthwhile to learn a deck that requires skills you do already have 
Building another aggro deck may be less productive than a control or midrange deck 
That said I wait to see what decks become popular in Standard 
Watch streamers play different decks and choose one that appeals to you 
I mulligan for Zoo keeping Wrath 
Four Peers is a lot of Peers if you not also playing Farseeks to be more aggressive about comboing 
Tyler Hill version tends to play a slower game 
He prioritizes more protection spells and resiliency evidenced by two Wild Defiances and Scryings in the main 
He also hates losing to Burn so he does have four Probes and boards in Wall of Roots 
I board in Baloths when they are good for the matchup 
Aggressive decks but not Affinity or Infect and decks where you want greater threat density 
Creatures in the main do contribute to your primary gameplan so they are worth it 
You are going to actually kill people with your maindeck Hooting Mandrills or whatever because they have removal spells 
Wait until they board them out 
Krosan Grip is my answer of choice if the Blood Moon player has counterspells 
Also fine against Goblins if a bit slow 
They are much less consistent than the checklands and wo see any real play 
I do think Glittering Wish was ever good 
Dark Iron Dwarf is a solid replacement 
Of course think that 
Primarily comprised of cardboard 
Wastes does work that way 
EU LAVA It why the server stinks 
Relevant https 
I been having success with something very close to Shaheen Soorani Esper Dragons and I been thoroughly impressed by Sorin 
Makes me wonder if the deck would be better without the dragons playing Sorins and grinding the opponent out 
I once Thoughtstole Curses of Rafaam 
I chuckled at the irony 
is the most natural fit for the cards you listed 
Fauna Shaman and Archangel do feature in that deck though you could try your own version that does include them but this is the best deck that uses those fetchlands outside of Infect 
If you do it right you always get a Scapeshift or a really good sideboard card 
Your opponent does actually get a real say 
I tried playing an Esper Mentor deck splashing red for Kommand and also a Jeskai version splashing black for Kommand and Lingering Souls and I found the biggest issue to be your life total 
This is a very slow deck and Helixes and Shambling Vents really are enough to stop your opponents from burning you out 
The first solution that comes to mind is putting the Kommands in the sideboard so that you do need to get black in game and thus can take a bit less pain 
The matchups where you actually want Kommand tend to prioritize life totals less anyway 
Another solution is to start with Grixis and splash the white for Lingering Souls and some sideboard cards perhaps Restoration Angel as well 
Scapeshift 
I have tested with my Gifts version for quite a while but the basis of that deck is to Gifts for Scapeshift Snapcaster Mage Noxious Revival and another good card so that you are guaranteed a Scapeshift 
Your sideboard cards get a lot better letting you do things like Gifts for four different counterspells or for three different Affinity hosers or some other powerful play 
If you interested in building that deck make sure to research thoroughly the different cards that are played in Scapeshift decks so that you can choose the best options for the numerous flex slots 
Also remember your lands 
Manamorphose does do what this deck wants 
You have plenty of ramp spells so getting your colors is perfectly fine 
You want to interact with your opponent and cantrip through your deck neither of which Manamorphose does as efficiently as other options like Anticipate Peer Through Depths etc 
Guttural Response is worse than Dispel 
Primal Command is maindeckable 
I played a package in the sideboard before to beat Jund and Grixis but in your maindeck it does contribute to the gameplan of delaying your opponent and finding your win condition 
You really want the most efficient spells that focus on your core plan in game 
Viridian Corrupter is the best answer to Chalice 
Past that Hurkyl Recall is fine depending on what decks you expect to be casting the Chalice 
Hurkyl is great if Affinity or Tron is doing it but very bad if Eldrazi is playing Chalice 
This website https provides a guide to looking at pictures of the Sun safely 
I was referring to Gideon Jura which you can also cast for five mana and does a lot more than BtL for Hunting Wilds 
Getting two lands is probably worse than Gideon effect but I guess we can discard this comparison 
There are literally Gifts Ungiven Scapeshift decks 
I enjoyed playing it back when Twin and Jeskai Control were on top 
Gifts is just limited to decks you seen in tournaments or whatever so please do dismiss things offhand without doing some research in the nicest way possible 
Gifts versions are really good when blue decks are popular as I expect them to be going forward 
You generally Gifts for Scapeshift Noxious Revival Snapcaster Mage whatever 
Peer costs two mana at instant speed 
BtL costs five at sorcery speed 
Again I do like the card because it clunky 
Agreed on the mana 
It been pretty rough getting the colors to work out mostly because you locked into playing the manlands 
Is four Vendilion Cliques too many 
That was the first thing I disliked about Paulo list after the mana 
The second is so much worse 
In my experience RUG is much more consistent in terms of playable draws 
BtL has some hands that are just disgusting and do cast relevant spells and my colors are awkward enough on RUG that four colors feels like too much 
The mana bad in BtL you trying to play seven basics and lands that do tap for blue alongside four Cryptic Commands and sometimes Angers 
Ramp helps but not always 
If you going to BtL for Hunting Wilds or whatever then that not that great IMO 
Gideon does way more than that and nobody plays Gideon 
If you getting some bullet then that legitimately powerful and that the biggest draw to the deck 
If you just getting Scapeshift I play Gifts Ungiven or Peer instead in a heartbeat because those cards let you play like a real control deck 
Being able to do all of that is nice but again mana issues and tapping out into counterspells and resiliency on the other side of the table is rough 
I aware that most people will disagree with me but that more or less why I have always played RUG 
Can confirm 
Drew what I pretty sure was the nuts with Faeries and still lost to a Jund player who understood what mattered much better than I 
Ancestral Vision is pretty poor for Scapeshift 
I would prefer to suspend Search for Tomorrow on turn one and as you said the deck prefers cards like Anticipate which can dig for your win condition more quickly and consistently than Vision 
Also Scapeshift is really good at being live to win off the top and Vision is anything but that 
I played very little BtL Scapeshift because I think the deck is fundamentally poor in Modern 
It even more clunky has even worse mana and has some other issue more than the RUG version 
As for RUG I strongly feel you should play Lightning Bolt 
Ever 
Not unless you have something broken like Dig or Gifts to recoup the card you lost 
It important to remember that you need eight cards to win the game 
Every card you draw should ideally cycle make mana or kill your opponent 
I wrote a primer here http that a bit old and thus has some incorrect information but hopefully it still useful 
Yep 
I playing some Darkslick Shores not sure if that or Watery Graves is right 
Can you explain how double combo is worse than single combo if you know what your opponents will be playing 
I ca see how the standard version is best against an unknown field but not good against specific parts of the field 
I really liking PVDDR Faeries deck 
It felt really clunky in the first couple of tests so I slimmed it down with more discard and additional removal 
Four Vendilion Cliques also seemed like a lot 
No idea on sideboarding though 
Vision seems pretty poor in Storm as the deck wants to kill on turn and drawing a dead card can fizzle you 
Jundy decks do get better when a draw becomes legal and Thirst for Knowledge probably sees more play 
I not sure about in Lantern Control but it seems pretty poor if all you doing is gaining life with it 
I do know where I would be without my daily dose of Legacy 
Probably losing at Hearthstone 
My favorite was the fucking VOLCANO 
Stones may explode 
I am playing a pretty standard Midrange Druid with no tech cards except for MC Tech over the second Shade 
This https is more or less the stock version of the deck 
I am sitting at rank and am facing lots of aggro decks mainly Hunter and Shaman 
What changes could I make to make the deck stronger against aggro 
I find that I am generally able to kill my opponent just in time or die a turn before I would win 
Should I cut one Living Roots for an Aspirant 
Is Sludge Belcher worth playing 
Midrange Druid is the best deck and it super consistent 
It may feel boring but it wins games 
Zoo is also very strong so long as you can find the right cards for the flex slots 
It really a matter of what you feel most comfortable playing 
Dig Scapeshift 
Please 
It lets me draw two cards from my deck 
I would attack into the Secretkeeper with a Sapling to check for Noble Sacrifice 
If the secret is something else kill the Secretkeeper with your hero power and the other Sapling and Innervate Wild Growth 
Our plan is to follow up with Shredder where at best he can play a Minibot 
If the secret is Noble Sacrifice Innervate Shredder 
I think this is better than Wild Growth because Mysterious Challenger gets a lot worse when you do have the board and Shredder helps you kill their stuff more proactively 
Not enough people have this policy 
It very important 
Egg Druid makes a super sticky board of minions Haunted Creeper Dragon and Nerubian Eggs Mounted Raptor Echoing Ooze and maximizes Soul of the Forest with a bunch of tokens and such 
It finishes with Savage Roar and Power of the Wild

It exceedingly linear 
Your game plan folds to certain cards Liliana of the Veil most notably and there is less play to the deck than others 
You do get access to some cool interactions and sideboard cards but beware that you may become bored 

It not super consistent 
You are mulliganing for one of creatures and the deck is known to take itself out of a game by simply not drawing the right cards 
It can be difficult to actually win an event with Bogles because you can just draw terribly sometimes 
I generally able to just kill my opponent after drawing my deck 
I think the keys to the matchup are your minions and getting the most out of your Oils and Flurries 
I managed to beat Tank Up occasionally when my opponent did have any pressure 
Having them not draw weapons is useful as well 
You wo win with just one Oil in your deck I do think 
Boom is good but definitely get the second Oil in your deck 
I play a Roast if you want a similar effect 
I do think the question was Which one is the best 
I am sharing my opinion overly general and aggressive as it may seem 
RUGLyfe 
Bring to Light sucks and RG is cheesy 
Edit I guess some people disagree with my opinion 
Oops 
I like having access to blue cards but I do like poor mana and more clunky spells 
Midrange Druid is fairly consistent and has game against everything 
Build your deck to beat aggro Aspirants MC Tech maybe Belcher and you should do well 
I troll my friends so much with this song that I grown to enjoy it 
All your problems are solved by Eventide limited standout Slippery Bogle 
Ah yeah forgot about that one 
Perhaps Curiosity as well if one wants more Keen Senses 
What else is he in blue for 
Spectral Flight 
My understanding is that Affinity should be bringing in Etched Champion in this matchup 
Generally it too slow and playing faster cards is better 
Shatterstorm beats Champion pretty well 
So does killing them fast after Angering or Grudging some stuff 
My play would be to silence one Armorsmith with Keeper then kill the Corsair with Living Roots 
Hit the other Armorsmith with your Shade then Keeper the Patron and Swipe the Patron 
This leaves you with Force of Nature in hand and a board of two and a against his 
I like this play a bit better than yours as you leave your opponent with a smaller board presence while using the same amount of cards 
He keeps his Corsair and a 
I suppose there an argument for keeping your Shade stealthed but I strongly prioritize gaining control of the board 
Elise allows you to focus on beating faster decks by playing more removal spells while still having a way to go long against other control decks 
The random legendaries can sometimes be bad but frequently give you the extra punch you need against Renolock and such 
My guess as to why Slam has become more popular is that there are fewer minions and cycling through your deck to keep up with cheap minions is important 
I interested in playing this deck but am curious what the best replacement for Leeroy is 
Doomguard is my instinctive answer but with all the burst I am not sure if Arcane Golem or Argent Horserider or even Reckless Rocketeer would be a better replacement 
Rogue 
I agree that it was correct pinging Shredder is lower damage EV than pinging face but just because a play worked does mean it was correct 
I prefer throwing my lands a different way Borborygmos of an angry variety style 
Choke 
It does that job worse than Minamo and Oboro however 
Dies to Drake Prankenhieb 
I think I confused myself 
I thought Vision is great with Bloodbraid 
thought of old RG versions that have Kitchen Finks and stuff then realized it bad with your Remands 
In short Bloodbraid is pretty good in a version that is built a bit differently 
The most recent list I can find is Ersee from DreamHack Winter http 
I would play it if Bloodbraid Elf was also unbanned 
Not sure about just Vision alone 
Can someone convince me on Piloted Shredder Tomb Pillager in Oil Rogue 
I played predominantly Shredder versions but I recently been playing with ChessDude version of the deck and Tomb Pillager has its own ups and downs and I frequently been quite impressed with the card 
Hand s Keep 
This is the riskiest of your five so I would hope to draw a land to play Agent on turn and protect it 
Hand s Keep 
Smirk to yourself and let your opponent know that Elvish Ranger is a really cool card 
Hand s Keep 
This has everything we want 
Protection a way to get some damage in and information 
Hand s Keep 
I like this because you can kill their Spellskite and you can kill on turn with appropriate draws 
Hand s Keep 
This is probably the most controversial but I think that killing Melira and Spellskite is of utmost importance in this matchup 
You have an answer and your list is a bit higher on pump spells so we can draw some speed 
You can convince me the other way though 
Amnesiac also seemed to concede some games pretty early 
He seems a bit more confident that he knows what going to happen 
It is time we shape our destiny with our own hands especially our thumbs the symbol of our biological complexity 
Why would they give you a large chunk of a set you wo get to play with for another month and a half 
It makes a lot more sense to build hype this way 
It a strategy that MtG uses liberally 
I still have a theory that I the only real person and everyone else is a thing designed to test how I react to certain situations and how I end up 
You should know that you wrong 
This is strictly better since they also make a Reddit post 
Scapeshift You forgot RUG the best version IMO 
What I mean is that you can make it a or whatever by setting up but then it ca die to your opponent minions 
You can keep hitting for a lot if you can get past their taunts 
I definitely thought Kansas City first 
The two are equally unplayable as far as I concerned 
Frothing Berserker is really cool if you can set up a big turn with it 
Edit IDK why I assumed this was talking about tavern brawl 
JACE THEY ARE TRYING ANYMORE DO SOMETHING CLEVER TO FUCK WITH YOUR OPPONENT DRAW SOME CARDS IN A CLEVER WAY JACE WINS THE GAME IN AN INCREDIBLY CLEVER FUN AND INTERACTIVE WAY 
Do you have a girlfriend 
content When did the posts on this subreddit start passing for content 
It too early for this 
Did you have maindeck Echoing Truth at any point to bounce a Chalice for 
Also has applications against lots of other things of course 
You mean just regular Modern 
The format they removed for PTs and replaced with Eldrazi 
Play your Valakut cast Scapeshift with double Remand backup 
Win 
Assuming you have a stock version you can sacrifice all your lands except for the Valakuts and get mountains 
Hah what an idiot 
Midrange Pally is garbage 
The rain of salt is so heavy here that we forgotten that what you supposed to do 
People seem to really like Ensnaring Bridge to beat Eldrazi 
I say Lantern is the best Bridge deck unless you count the Affinity deck with Bridge Grid in the board 
As for the very aggressive matchups I been impressed by Sam Black maindeck Pyroclasms 
Magic kinda does 
There and 
Would it be accurate to say that Coin Arcane Explosion is a good play either 
I mean 
Seems like tech for Show and Tell since they usually ca win immediately 
The way I think about it there are five flex slots one of which should be a cantrip and one of which can be a land 
The starting point for me is Therapy Duress 
I seen lists that play five discard spells and lists that play eight 
I Reynad I Reynad 
Reynad Reynad Reynad 
https 
Have you ever seen them make reads that were wrong 
People can also abuse emotes if they think others will put stock in them 
I just think that anything that is certain that is everything except your opponent lines of play should be considered too seriously 
The cards do what they say and interact with each other the same regardless of what your opponent cardback is 
Things like decks golden heroes or your opponent emotes which exist outside the game never influence your 
It better to assume all your opponents are good so that you can play well regardless 
We gon na be rich twice 
Boxers or briefs 
Very cool 
I am always intrigued how closely the HS versions resemble the MtG versions despite how very different the games are 
You do need to read every thread every single day you just need to look at the front page 
I mostly play Modern but play Standard whenever I have an excuse to play Esper Dragons 
Whee 
Lightning Bolt 
What do you mean by full value 
Would I get to dust my Force of Natures for dust apiece 
I have been around long enough to see a craftable card nerfed 
It should be noted that Anthony list is from an obsolete format 
Faeries is a very slow deck and Twin was one of its best matchups 
If it was barely playable then I do think it comes close now 
Did you notice the dankness of my meme 
I confused by this 
I was kinda wondering if we could shut the fuck up about banlist changes for a little while 
The cards do what they say 
We moved away from Cystic Fibrosis 
Just not that appealing anymore 
I would play the deck if you do have Cryptic Commands 
You mean like 
The dreaded invisible hat and jacket 
Huntmaster of the Fells on Brann is brilliant 
I playing Viridian Corrupter in my now and even an illogically greedy person like me had to cut to Spellskites in the 
Maybe I should only have 
That seems like the best place to be going forward since we have to beat Chalice and Affinity 
My opponent made a Edwin and greeted me 
I Spellbroke it 
Later another Edwin and another greeting 
I Spellbroke it 
Into uninstall 
Excuse me if I missed something but is Goblin Bushwhacker better 
They have the same effect but the Goblin costs less and is a better topdeck 
Well done on your excellent record 
I looking to pick up Affinity as I wanted to play it for a good while 
On your Scapeshift match Cryptic Commands start coming out after Remands and random clunky they might have like Baloth or whatever 
As you know at worst it Fog draw a card 
Your opponent probably did have too many cards to bring in to take out all of his Cryptics 
Keeping in Remand is certainly wrong 
Eye of Ugin and Eldrazi Temple are best friends with colorless Eldrazi 
Not so much colored ones 
Racists 
Then do let that happen 
Remand things 
Find sufficient protection for your combo 
Kill stuff 
Board in Baloths 
The matchup should be very good for you with Geist being the worst but still favorable 
Their plan is to kill you as fast as possible 
I recommend boarding in Firespouts to kill Geist as that is nearly the only way they can win 
Counter kill or bounce everything else 
Four Chalice of the Void 
Calm down 
Sideboard I believe this is LSV Gut Shot Pithing Needle Oblivion Sower Ratchet Bomb Relic of Progenitus Spellskite Warping Wail 
Quality shitpost 
I recommend RUG 
I certain that you want a blue version not the RG version 
BtL versions of the deck feel very linear and easy to me and I think that playing RUG offers a challenge as well as a great deal of customizability and mana consistency 
Blighted Agent is the best infect creature by a mile 
Giving that up in addition to counterspells and Twisted Image is a lot 
i do Infect is the kind of deck that wants discard spells 
We need several cards to win and do have the card manipulation to interact and kill quickly 
I found the matchup really easy 
You can beat discard spells and they have very little removal 
Play against it like you would Abzan 
Absolutely 
Hearthstone has had relatively few expansions which leads to the incorrect conclusion that the Classic set is vital to the game 
To use another MtG reference that like saying ABUR should have always been Standard legal 
It important to consider the long term here where enough cards are released that people have new things to be excited about and any single expansion matters less 
I choose Pyroclasm over Fallout if I would play either because double red is painful and costing one less lets me leave up counterspell mana for their answer anyway 
I always had Firespout since Pod left 
Three damage is important single red is important instant speed is not 
You can play Pyroclasm if you do expect much Zoo Merfolk Company or Kiki Chord 
I drunk 
lands makes sense given that you trying to support Champions and some more expensive SB cards 
I think the decision comes down to preference 
I switch the fourth Glimmervoid and Springleaf Drum 
Glimmervoid seems like the absolute worst topdeck as it is even an artifact 
You keep the same number of colored sources 
Destructive Revelry is pretty silly 
Against Affinity you usually win or lose by a mile so it only OK against Tron 
I still rather pay mana 
Every other deck will get to 
Crumble to Dust is likely a better choice than Boomerang 
Jaddi Offshoot is worse than other lifegain you could play 
I usually play Krosan Grip as my enchantment removal of choice 
Nature Claim may take that spot now but certainly not Natural State 
Additional downside ETB tapped as far as mana goes 
Most people recommend buying Naxxramas 
You get access to Haunted Creeper Nerubian Egg and eventually Sludge Belcher and Loatheb in the first wings which are played in multiple decks 
Why not just regular Living End 
I do think having a better Eldrazi matchup is worth crippling your manabase and having awful and clunky cards in your deck 
If you concerned with faster combo decks be faster yourself or play disruption like Macabre or even discard 
It not that you ca count it that you contractually obligated to attack the face with your Bluegill Warrior 
We do need your money money money 
I agree with pretty much everything you said here 
I really like versions and hate Lightning Bolt 
Countering Karn with Izzet Charm is a great feeling I really like copies of Charm right now 
As for the manabase I am confident that the optimal version is the following Breeding Pool Flooded Grove Misty Rainforest Steam Vents Stomping Ground Cinder Glade Island Forest Mountain Valakut the Molten Pinnacle Desolate Lighthouse 
How so 
The power level shifts up in both Arena and Constructed 
If every card is good the same number of cards will still be unplayable 
Ice Rager 
Why would you play this card 
I see Giant Potato Monster 
A more accurate representation of Iona effect would be Your opponent ca play spells 
How does that sound 

Emrakul has protection from colored 
I even put on my cap and everything 
Hmm well played 
BtL for Anger is pretty good 
That plus Izzet Charms should be OK 
Even if you are still a dog you have five Shatterstorms or five Meliras or whatever postboard 
I do think it a good idea to overload on removal in the main 
Depends on what version you playing 
BtL can afford to play 
If RUG I normally play none as well because I prefer cantrips 
However you should be playing Electrolyze 
It too good not to play unless you are going hard on 
That pretty standard yes 
seems to be the sweet spot that the hive mind has reached 
Disappointed not to see Griselbrand 
Very well done regardless 
You can target Emrakul with abilities from colored permanents like creatures or planeswalkers 
Much simpler 
Damnation is the Magic card 
Beautiful 
Avenger of Zendikar looks incredible on Rumbling Elemental 
Would it be possible to add the names of the Magic cards whose art you used 
I recognize some of them but I sure it would be helpful to people to find these cards online 
That good to hear 
I guess I still have a lot to figure out 
To whom it may concern if you found this letter that means Gary food bowl is empty and that it needs to be refilled 
It also means it been approximately one year since I split town and no one noticed now 
No one needs to worry I wo bother anyone again 
Sincerely SpongeBob 

Idiot Boy 
It really really slow and does do too much to protect the main game plan in Modern 
I considered playing white for Path and Dromoka Command 
Command is really cool 
Your mom 
Is Hunting Wilds not good anymore 
I remember people saying that it was your second most used BtL target 
I confident that the optimal manabase for RUG is Breeding Pool Flooded Grove Steam Vents Stomping Ground Cinder Glade Forest Island Mountain Misty Rainforest Valakut the Molten Pinnacle Desolate Lighthouse As for a standard list there is one 
There are about cards that you should be playing regardless for RUG but the other slots are totally up to you 
You can play a bunch of cantrips some removal and sweepers Izzet Charms bounce spells whatever 
The Tier system is more or less arbitrary anyway 
It just a means of defining more quantitatively what the best decks are something that people have a pretty good sense of already 
That is we know that Hybrid Hunter is poor but giving it a tier number gives a slightly better sense of exactly how poor it is 
When they really fighting with huge minions and devastating spells 
It just my way of thinking about the matchup 
You can be right if you want 
My thought process is that if they are able to get rid of our cards and deny us draw steps we ca find sufficient resources to win 
This takes a lot of doing however as they do actually need multiple discard spells and a Liliana to get there 
You right that resource denial is enough which is why I stressed the importance of a and making sure they do get that eventuality 
Yes it an combo 
If you force them to discard ramp spells they are discarding combo pieces and have to spend more turns finding additional parts 
From my experience playing Scapeshift I find that this is an appropriate way to think of the matchup 
I trying to get to seven mana as fast as possible and rip a Scapeshift to win 
You trying to get me to discard cards so that I do have sufficient resources to win 
I play Scapeshift 
I understand that Liliana can be dealt with 
It still the best route to victory backed by a clock 
Yes mess with their resources is the Abzan gameplan 
It just particularly important to understand why it good here 
Scapeshift has a very hard time beating turn Liliana 
Remember that it an combo so attacking their resources is of utmost importance 
This means their lands hand and draw steps 
LD discard and a clock do these things 
I not sure what you mean there are no Taunt minions in that pack 
No luck needed 
Just have fun 

I going to go faster 
I moved Mutagenic Growth back into the deck and I moved my maindeck Dismember and Spell Pierce to the board 
The only maindeck nonstandard cards are Twisted Images which seem wonderful for Affinity and Tron maindeck Spellskites 
In the sideboard four Nature Claims and a Hurkyl Recall if you want it 
Spell Pierce is very powerful now as you can counter most of Bx Eldrazi but especially the discard spells and nab a Karn or Pyroclasm against Tron 
From my admittedly limited testing against Eldrazi the matchup seems favorable 
Their maindeck interaction is limited to discard a couple of removal spells and Wasteland Strangler 
If we can beat Jund we can certainly beat this stuff 
taught me this while he taught me Miracle Rogue 
I ca say I not it 
Edit Word choice 
The last bit was more geared towards the I hope they come up with a good solution to this problem in the next couple sets bit 
You ca just that 
Very few games are decided by manascrew certainly much less than by mistakes 
You have to actually be a professional to lose more games to variance than playskill as far as I concerned 
Again not arguing that mana variance in Magic sucks 
However I think the benefits afforded by lands make the system a net positive 
At the very least they turned it into a net positive 
I find it very difficult to believe that you lost due to manascrew more often than your own misplays 
I would argue that having only live topdecks is a fix for any problem in Magic 
They just different systems 
You seem to have had a bad experience with lands and it stuck with you 
Your last phrase demonstrates a serious lack of understanding about how game design works 

People make the issue of mana screw seem much worse than it really is 
A properly built deck will not screw you over that much 
There no need to change the rule because it imposes limits on the difficulty of costs of spells you can play you ca just play four Cryptic Commands with very few blue producing lands 
Any new random idea for managing mulligans or mana is likely just worse than the current system 
What Reynad describes as a fundamental flaw of Magic actually provides a ton of additional design space 
I wo argue that mana variance is an issue in Magic because sometimes people just do get to play 
People do exacerbate this however 
On the other hand lands in Magic do so much 
Lands can turn into creatures lands can search for creatures lands can copy other lands lands can draw cards some lands do even tap for mana and instead have some very powerful effect 
There an entire subgame built into lands that involves providing you additional versatility usually tapping for two or more colors or having a effect in exchange for some drawback which I find interesting as well 
I think that lands provide an additional benefit in deck design 
You have tons of options when it comes to colors and utility and you have to find the right balance of mana in addition to spells where Hearthstone only mandates that you build an appropriate curve of 
It simply adds another facet of deckbuilding for players to mess with 
To be clear I not trying to bash HS 
I just think that Reynad assessment of lands is missing some pieces 
tl dr Lands provide additional design space 
It will be as much of a thing as Oath of Druids in Modern https 
Affinity being a historically bad matchup and having access to Relic of Progenitus in large numbers makes me think LE is poorly positioned 
You sir are scum 
Well done 

I think I would play Ad Nauseam or some other fast combo deck perhaps Grishoalbrand with a good sideboard plan for Affinity 
There wo be that many blue decks so you only have to worry about discard and decks that are faster than you 
Storm seems reasonable as well 
Good luck 
Do bomb the draft 
Delver lost its best matchup so I do think people will play that from a strictly winning perspective 
Twin and Bloom were matchups Affinity is a bad matchup and people will sideboard like hell for Tron 
I would still play Unravel Claim or Krosan Grip over Natural State I think 
I might have to switch to BtL or a more build of RUG 
Probably four Bolts and Firespout in the main which sounds gross but I have to and Crumble to Dust Shatterstorm in the board to start 
We see how things shake out at the PT 
The deck is base UG 
You have Cryptic Command so the fetchland needs to be blue 
You have Search for Tomorrow and Tribe Elder so the fetchland needs to be green 
I on RUG 
I plan on Remanding Karn dodging Ulamog and killing on turn 
Postboard Crumble to Dust targeting Urza Power Plant 
Not sure why people think Scapeshift will pick up with Twin gone 
Twin was a good matchup Affinity is a bad matchup and people will sideboard like hell for Tron 
I am liking Temur Moons to beat Tron and Affinity 
You got the free win built in Tron and a reasonable RUG deck vs Affinity plus all the good sideboard cards 
I play this deck if you want four Snapcaster Mages 
What do you think you be playing year from now 
Blue Moon with Tarmogoyfs 
Asking the real questions 
I be playing it in Infect 
It time for my favorite sideboard card to come out and play 
Garbage card A Garbage card B Shatterstorm Garbage card C 
Let her have fun 
You do need to be a spike to play HS 
threatened with trash duty the wild Mysterious Challenger will reveal its 
You got that right Miracle Rogue is super fun to play 
I currently on a Primal Command package Command Baloth Thragtusk Teferi 
Command comes in against everyone that is fast combo or Affinity it super good 
I keep a straight face 
Too straight 
I a Monastery Mentor guy but yes 
So much yes 
Alternatively I going to emote the shit out of this guy when I win 
This happens to me when I am clicking through my collection very quickly 
Have seen it otherwise 
Mysterious Challenger too because something different happens every time you play it and they do know what to expect 

Scapeshift is an card combo deck 
I highly dislike low impact cards because each time you want to interact you need to replace the card with a new one to make sure your deck works smoothly 
Bolt does draw a card and frequently does very little to stop your opponent game plan 
If they are an aggressive deck it obviously good but otherwise it very mediocre 
You never Bolt them to win the game so it not as versatile as Twin Bolts 
Edited my post 
I love Bring to Light I hate a bunch of other things 
I hate Lightning Bolt in this deck with a burning passion 
Cryptic Command is a sin 
Maindeck Angers always felt awful to me because we already have a million garbage cards to draw and they just add to it in certain matchups 
A couple of small manabase things Flooded Grove is good Breeding Pool is too many I really like Loothouse 
Well done 
I have to give Sarkhan a try 
My plan BGx is always to survive so I prefer Thragtusk and occasionally Wurmcoil Engine or Primal Command 
This is why I always make my opponents actually kill me rather than conceding both in Magic and in Hearthstone 
They can always screw up and something unexpected can always happen 
I remember my first game of Ranked play 
I passed on turn and my opponent Coined out Arcane Explosion 
The Top decklists from the Cincinnati Open are on the SCG website and the coverage page for the event 
I am a proponent of playing no Fulminators or other cards specific to big mana matchups in BGx sideboards and focusing on improving other matchups 
I do think that committing slots is worth it and does help enough because you wo draw them consistently 
If you going to play Fulminators play and make sure you actually win the matchups where you bring them in 
Three more months and you got yourself a Boom 
You never guess what in that conveniently box A bunch of TNT 
In what world are Infect and Affinity fair decks 
This is why I frequently get my pack and get out 
People on this sub seem to underrate how big an accomplishment Legend is 
It really quite impressive and indicates a high level of 
That said I am a huge proponent of choosing one deck that has reasonable matchups among the best decks and becoming very comfortable with it 
You can get to Legend by playing the best deck but you can only do very well if you have mastered a deck 
Try doing that next season if possible 
The only legendary I have and I did even need to craft him 
Boom 
Also Doomguard because it my favorite card 
Storm faces either a faster clock or too much disruption in its common matchups to be really strong 
Burn Affinity Twin and Jund all present one or both of these issues 
The deck is very linear and you do get to interact much with your opponent outside of corner cases 
Scapeshift and Twin both have an explosive kill which you seem to enjoy and are significantly more interactive than Storm 
Both of those are good starting points 
Some people play Mountains but I found that to be tremendously awkward and totally unnecessary to beat Ghost Quarter 
I currently play Mountain and Cinder Glade alongside the shocklands 
I do know where Islands and Forests comes from 
Islands and Forests is the norm with some players having a third Forest or a fourth Island 
Stomping Ground flashes back Ancient Grudge 
The reasoning for Stomping Ground over Breeding Pool which might seem more useful is that you can fetch an Island and cast both halves of Grudge and Stomping Ground lets you fetch a Mountain later to get RR for Twin 
I say it closer to the Standard Affinity decks 
The actual affinity for artifacts ability is just like Mechwarper 
Knightfall seems like a natural fit to what you have 
People play versions that are built like a deck with Retreat to Coralhelm for an instant kill 
Since you like comboing out and complex synergies this seems perfect 
Also Eidolon 
What worked for me counting the damn cards in my hand 
How the hell are we supposed to find lethal if we ca count to ten people 
Pod could kill Scapeshift quickly enough to race the combo 
Especially with Dig the deck just had enough removal and other delaying tactics to find seven lands and win the game 
Also Inferno Titan is a house 
Do you think that Geist would be a reasonable option for the finisher slots 
You got lots of cheap interaction and a couple of wraths so getting him through unimpeded seems feasible 
Bolts Helixes Paths and a couple of Electrolyzes should do you just fine 
I not a fan of Warleader Helix because Restoration Angel is usually just a better play 
Two of my favorites are Tin Fins and Trix 
Conversely you got more things like Jund in Magic 
It like saying Mage when asked what you playing in constructed 
Totally undescriptive just the that you are using 
Otherwise names are much the same as HS 
More recently it Lantern Control 
It a prison deck meaning it trying to prevent your opponent from doing anything 
It uses the card Lantern of Insight to see the top of your opponents deck and cards like Ghoulcallers Bell to ensure that they never draw what they want 
To avoid dying to aggression the deck uses Ensnaring Bridge 
The original name of Dick Pyx came from Pyxis of Pandemonium a card similar to Ghoulcallers Bell that was in the first builds of the deck 
Of course tournament coverage ca call it that 

I do think you can rely on Nissa getting to Sphinx Revelation mode 
People are to deal with a planeswalker given that Jace and others are everywhere 
They are also prepared to deal with tokens given that Atarka Red and Esper Tokens are strong decks 
In the Burn matchup sure 
Spellskite is great in other matchups and still very serviceable against Burn so I play four of that before any Walls 
Personally I never played a Wall 
Remember that the older variants were trying to reanimate Griselbrand and use Fury of the Horde to win the game 
Those will still be around if Shoal is banned so that seems like a reasonable move 
I ca be less greedy when I playing Tron or Infect or Scapeshift 
I do like that Blood Moon punishes people for simply taking advantage of an aspect of the game 
I not saying that Blood Moon is overpowered 
I think that it generally better for players if you are limited by what your spells can do rather than by whether or not you can play them 
I guess I meant to say Only one player gets to do anything 
Blood Moon makes for very uninteresting and frequently games 
Usually only one person is happy in a game involving Blood Moon and those games frequently become affairs 
Even if you can play around it there will still be games where cool things do happen because of this card 
I not a proponent of banning it but I not a fan 
Wall of Roots is specifically for the Burn matchup 
Stops their creatures for days while your Dispels and Spell Pierces stop their spells 
You usually only see people play this card after they have Spellskites in the because that card does the job better 
A friend of mine has a Kher Keep in UR Twin 
He claims a very high win percentage against BGx because of that card alongside maindeck Roasts 
Do tell me you would look sheepish writing Sance on your deck sheet 
I would bear the shame do worry about it 
Still there are about nine slots in the maindeck that I would feel shameful for registering in a tournament 

I BET THAT FUCKING TWIN PLAYER THINKS HE SO SMART HE BE THE ONE TO DO IT 
Can confirm that I derive pleasure from pulling wins out of my ass 
My current build of the deck has two copies of Painful Truths in the maindeck as well as two copies of Sorin Solemn Visitor to offset the lifeloss alongside a Vault of the Archangel 
Beyond that I got a relatively standard assortment of interaction including a Dispel and Cryptic Command 
I think that Truths has played a pivotal role in many matchups so long as the lifeloss is crippling 
Even against Affinity it is the best card to draw once you stabilized the board 
I think that the reason people are playing with Visions is that IoK seems to be the replacement for that card 
I think people should play both 
More cheap spells are good 
Is it crazy to cut Souls from the deck entirely 
I understand that it is very good alongside Mentor and provides additional threats in your deck but sometimes I feel like it clunks up hands and might be better off as Think Twice or another delve spell or Jaces so that you can play both Truths and Jace 
Can you link me to the RPTQ deck 
I also been banging my head against the wall with this deck trying to get all sorts of shells to work optimally 
My students do need a classroom to be threatening 
They simply watch me deftly cut through and slaughter my enemies scouring their minds and making them forget they ever tried to oppose me 
Sometimes I rely on the lurking slime of oil or the ethereal spirits to hide my students and I 
Other times I am unopposed as my students are inspired by the death throes of those who would kill them 
All this and I never say a word 
It was better when Delver and Pod were the best decks as you get to block lots of the early game creatures while you stabilize 
Also helped that it survives Anger which you had to play to beat Pod 
Now there is a matchup that particularly dominant and also good for Courser 
It good against Burn but so is Finks and people seem to prefer that 
Experimentally I found the percentages to be near 
Among those only Scapeshift is really winnable and discard spells do just fine 
Discard is also fine against Bloom though you are still rather unfavored 
Depending on metagame I can also see moving the Olivia to the main for a Huntmaster and playing a second Truths in the board 
Two feels like the right number to me 
The Scapeshift MU has gotten better with Newlamog 
Beating Tron has been as easy for me 
The Tron player can simply Eye for it or draw it naturally and I more or less lose on the spot 
Of note is that many players myself included have a Roast somewhere that can deal with pressure to buy time 
I have beaten a Liliana ultimate exactly once 
The key was that my opponent had no pressure so I had plenty of time to find lands 
Having Gifts Ungiven at that time was also helpful 
If your opponent has a Thalia or similar in play then you can pay different colors for Truths 
Thrun is a pain in the butt to most blue decks and at an affordable price too 
The key idea to understand is that Scapeshift needs cards to win the game sometimes 
That lands plus Scapeshift in hand or a Snapcaster Mage for a Scapeshift that was discarded earlier 
This means that since you can not interact with them through removal spells your job is to reduce the amount of cards they have access to over the course of the game through presenting a fast clock fewer turns fewer draw steps and using less spells and lands they have access to 
Having Liliana without a threat in play is frequently not good enough to because Scapeshift has bounce spells Snapcasters random burn to keep her off of ultimate 
My main plan against a Liliana draw out of is to simply get as many lands as I can into play even discarding Scapeshift to Liliana if I have to so that once I am hellbent I have enough mana that the top of my deck can kill you out of nowhere 
If you can get me into topdeck mode before I hit lands I have to get a lot luckier to win 
When you do have Liliana however it pretty easy to get to lands before dying 
Postboard your matchups gets better overall because of Fulminator Mages and extra discard spells 
From the Scapeshift side the sideboard plan is simply to increase the number of live topdecks through Baloths Thragtusks etc 
to buy more draw steps 
If you looking for specific trump cards Fulminators and Slaughter Games are good 
Woo 
Another person who running with the version of Scapeshift 
I not a fan of your Bolts and Angers though 
Was the second Mountain ever useful 
I have a second Flooded Grove because Mountains has been playing fine for me 
Now I wondering what would have happened if you lost that game 
Alternatively Hive Mind 
Here the real reason We want more live topdecks against BGx 
The matchups basically comes down to getting seven lands into play before your hand dies and trying to rip a Scapeshift off the top 
Having things like Thragtusk and Surrak and Titan and Wurmcoil gives you multiple additional draw steps or a card that can win on its own if your opponent has nothing in play 
Beating Blood Moon and Slaughter Games and stuff is only a mild concern 
As for Knuckleblade I agree 
The card is just as bad against Liliana as your other cards and is good enough in other matchups to be playable 
Play Rhino Twin focus on the beatdown plan more 
Eidolon is the real problem here 
Your focus should be to combo as quickly as possible but sideboard in Bolts to deal with this card 
Yes but replace the basics with Unhinged basics 
I not sure why you think Scapeshift is terrible 
I believe that Tom Ross had one in his deck at one point 
I found it to be very bad and unnecessary as this deck is much less than it was a year ago 
Especially since you got Visions you playing a slower build which is even worse for Pact 
Should I Lava Spike my opponent or myself if he has Dispel in hand 
Regardless of what you do your matchup against Amulet will be poor 
Fair decks that focus on playing to the board are generally to handle a Titan on turn followed by more Titans 
Since you are in black I would recommend some discard spells if you do have them already 
They certainly are a guaranteed victory but can put a serious damper on the Bloom player plans 
destruction is fine as well 
I really enjoy playing against blue decks especially those that operate mostly at instant speed 
Jeskai Control is a lot of fun to play against as are Twin variants especially Grixis 
One thing I think we can all agree on Tuck Fron 
Unravel the Aether Deicide Radiant Purge Revoke Existence are the cheapest ones 
EDIT How the hell did I forget about Celestial Purge 
Yep 
So long as you have Mountains on the battlefield when you resolve Scapeshift all the Mountains that entered play will trigger Valakut including itself since it is also a Mountain 
Noble Hierarch is the most important card assuming that you already have Blighted Agents 
After that I go for fetchlands and then supplementary cards like Visions Pierce Spellskite and other sideboard material 
I mostly like this manabase 
My changes are Breeding Pool Flooded Grove and Desolate Lighthouse for Mountain Misty and some spell 
lands feels right to me as does exactly battle land for now 
I think that Scapeshift is always if you build it correctly 
Every matchup that ca end the game before turn is even to favorable and for the really fast decks like Affinity Burn and fast combo a solid sideboard is all it takes to swing those matchups in your favor 
I think that there are ways you can go with the deck 
Either you play Visions some other cheap cantrips and a small removal suite to focus on a consistent turn kill or you play a bunch of Lightning Bolts and maindeck sweepers and Peer Through Depths to play a control deck with the combo as the kill 
I have always liked versions with Visions because I just feel bad using a card in my hand to deal with things I do necessarily care about 
I just have some sweepers and lifegain in the board and call it a day 
I really hate Bring to Light in this deck 
There is a serious cost to playing this card in your deck both in terms of mana and normal game flow 
I do want more expensive sorceries 
BtL is really only helpful against Jund and Grixis Control and marginally at that 
In other matchups it either too slow or too clunky to be worthwhile 
Sorry I meant to say that I was playing Scapeshift 
The point there is that all of the big mana decks have ways Blood Moon and so I do think the card is worth playing 
It a similar case with Fulminator Mage as well 
The other day my Jund opponent Blood Mooned on turn 
I killed him with a Thragtusk and an Inferno Titan 
I am firmly in the camp of conceding your matches against big mana at least as far as sideboarding goes 
The opportunity cost of the slots you are dedicating is a worse SB plan in other matchups and the extra slots are adding enough to merit playing them 
I do like going halfway on these things so I tend to play nothing at all 
If you think you must play mana denial I recommend Fulminators 
Perhaps try Magus he kind of a combination of Fulminator and Moon in that you can recur him with Kommand but he has the Blood Moon effect 
Infect just needs green fetchlands 
You can play between Foothills and Heath but you may decide that you want a and for that you need Misty 
Esper Control runs well with Khans fetches as Flooded Strand and Polluted Delta both get Island 
A more Grixis deck Blue Jund if you will can run fine off of Delta and Bloodstained Mire though you will have to invest in some Blackcleave Cliffs as well usually 
Grishoalbrand plays some Bloodstained Mires 
Scapeshift can be played with Foothills over Misty Rainforest though that is a suboptimal build 
You should have drawn Bolts duh 
Were you able to speak with your Scapeshift opponent about his deck 
I really hated BtL when I tested it because it was very clunky and only helped against midrangey decks with interaction marginally at that 
The pain to the manabase is very real 
I play Gatecrash Breeding Pools because I think the art is prettier 
Did know that made me basic 
I do think you got the joke 
Scapeshift 
Yesterday 
Bounce Liliana tap your creatures 
Thought Scour is played just because it gets cards into the bin 
It helps delve and Snapcaster Mage but we do play Tome Scour because Thought Scour cantrips 
Mill for total mana is better replaced by Glimpse the Unthinkable assuming you on Grixis but I would still rather draw a new card 
Another cards milled over does not count as a new card 
I see 
So you got a version of the Boros Dimir deck that lighter on red 
I think that if you combine all of the Twin variants Grixis UR Tarmo they take up a larger metagame share than Affinity 
Worth noting that a lot of the Tier decks are real because they have favorable to dominating matchups against many tier decks 
One such deck is Tokens which has very strong Twin and BGx matchups while being somewhat weak to better aggro decks and combo 
I think Infect is the best deck out of those four 
It great against random combo decks and packing a powerful and proactive game plan that will kill them if they stumble is a great place to be 
I firmly believe that you have to have some kind of free win in your deck to be competitive in Modern 
Elves is also a fine choice though I never liked the deck 
Whichever one fits your playstyle better is likely better for you to play 
I was a fan of Demars' deck to start with 
Now given that GW Megamorph is the top dog I like it even less 
That deck is very good at keeping your creatures at bay and can easily blow you out when you inevitably have to Battle Rage to get through blockers 
It a difficult matchup but I think that Hordeling Outburst Firecraft may be the way to go 
Go around their blockers alongside Command and burn them out 
When it comes to the sideboard I have been really liking Thunderbreak Regent as well as Twin Bolt over Arc Lightning 
Outpost Siege seems close to unplayable right now given that GW is on top 
I do think Tom had this in his list but the place Bant Megamorph deck had Dragonlord Ojutai which was more or less the reason to play that deck when it first came out at PT DTK 
Do you think splashing for Ojutai may be worth it 
I saw multiple mirror matches this weekend where the ground was super gummed up and Ojutai might be the best way to break through 
I keep coming back to Grixis Twin because I can play Steam Vents Steam Vents Watery Grave Sulfur Falls 
So wonderful 
Oh and the deck great too 
Radiant Purge most likely 
OP wants downvotes lets give them to him 
BW Tokens some Esper Control variants Gifts Loam Deadguy Ale Wilted Abzan and Esper Mentor are the decks that come to mind for Souls 
Scapeshift 
Such fun 
Will you still be brewing Grixis Temur Kiki Fae Chord 
You should discard your baby to Jace flip him and flash it back 
if you a netdecking speculator 
One could argue that the necessary description is in the linked article 
You can find my full list of complaints on the Vodkary 
It all right there in the Bill of Rights 
If you ca equip Skullclamp to Runeclaw Bear anymore think about what the kids in third world countries A B and C are doing 
Can I downvote and still receive benefits 
Volley does hit Savage Knuckleblade and Anafenza as well as Mantis Rider more consistent earlier in the game than Impulse 
PSA This was an awful PSA 
PSA PSA PSA PSA 
I leave this tidbit http here 
BBD answers Jason Rotenberger question about decklists in articles by pros 
I do think it fair to writers to expect them to reveal all of their information 
They make a living on tournament success and if they feel that letting their idea get out will hurt that they have the decision to not share it with you 
I do think however that any writer is explicitly trying to misinform readers 
for the pun A otherwise 
Comes out to a solid as far as I concerned 

Jace dies to Twisted Image 
Twisted Image costs less than a dollar 
I do get how Magic is a marketable product anymore 
I believe that the sideboard he has for this event is Anafenza the Foremost Disdainful Stroke Duress Encase in Ice Ob Nixilis Reignited Radiant Flames Radiant Purge Silumgar Command Silumgar the Drifting Death 
Yep 
I glad I managed to get the list from a fellow on XMage 
It quite strong though I not confident the deck actually wants BtL 
For formatting remember that the are called matches and the individual games are called well games 
I believe Gerry has Reave Soul in his maindeck 
As far as the battle lands go I would play more than a Cinder land over a basic Mountain 
We have enough turn plays usually around between Bolt Visions Search that the tapland feels awkward for me 
As for Bring to Light I do like it very much because it clunky and makes the mana very very hard 
I wo be playing it 
The battle lands enter tapped a lot more frequently than you would think 
Remember that even though we have basics many hands just have lots of shocklands 
I much rather pay life than not be able to cast spells on time 
Why would I play this card when I could just play Siege Rhino on turn 
You people need to think more about what goes on in the Vintage metagame 
A friend plays Raise the Alarm and a Secure the Wastes over Blossom saying that it weakens bad matchups and makes good matchups better and so is not worth inclusion 
I tried a Cinder Glade over a Mountain in Scapeshift but it turned out to be awkward enough that I cut it 
How about Leaking a turn Tasigur 
That depends on how controlling you want to be but getting rid of it sounds better to me than drawing a card that is on average worse than Tasigur 
I like a Dispel and a Mana Leak 
Dealing with threats completely feels important enough to this controlling deck that having a Leak sounds nice 
OP suggested playing Krasis over Exarch meaning that all of your combo creatures would die to Bolt 
I saying that a configuration like Exarch Krasis would be better 
I like lands in this deck 
The curve is a bit lower than that of UR and Grixis which usually play and you are trying to support a more aggressive game plan that does want to draw as many lands 
In a similar vein I do like Lumbering Falls because CIPT hurts the tempo plan too much for what it does 
As for the configuration I test against I cut down to fetches the blue ones and play a third Sulfur Falls over MD Ghost Quarter that is in the sideboard 
Bounding Krasis is great 
I play it over Pestermite so that you still have a combo creature that can survive a Bolt 

People have answers 

Twin does always have it 

They usually wo just jam on turn 

There are other decks like this that kill even more quickly in some cases with greater consistency 
In the early game you can play it as Divination 
Later on however it is incredible to regrow with Kommand because you frequently just make a flyer in a topdeck war 
It can be a bit clunky but the power is certainly there 
mirrors go very long anyway so it OK that it costs or mana 
Spreading Seas is a big reason for Merfolk wins in the Jund matchup and I think it similar reasoning here 
Messing with their mana and cycling keeps the gas flowing while hampering their curve and interaction 
He had the Dispel but I had Terminate and Reddit at the ready 
Mulldrifter is particularly strong because it synergizes well with Kommand 
Some people like Grave Titan and Bitterblossom as well though those do provide the raw cards 
These kinds of games do happen against Twin 
If there one deck in the format that plays incredibly interesting and interactive games it Twin 
They do always combo on turn 
The fact that it forces you to have removal ready IN YOUR HAND when they go for Splinter Twin 
Is there any deck to which this does apply 
If you do have the proper interaction you lose 
Why do you not have an issue with faster decks such as Grishoalbrand Infect and Ad Nauseam 
Why the hell did I choose to involve myself in this 
Bad EchoWhiz 
I like Baloths vs Chapin deck because they still provide additional pressure and at worst gain ish life 
Sorry I may not have made myself clear 
In my experience Scapeshift is favored in the matchup 
Thragtusk is particularly great and the other fatties are good too 
Counterspells help a lot and Grixis has a tough time beating Boseiju 
From the Scapeshift side Grixis is slightly favorable and very favorable in my experience 
EDIT I saying that Scapeshift is favored 
Grixis is by far the most powerful 
The finishers are very efficient and the Kommand Snap engine is very difficult to beat 
Scapeshift is very expensive while sadly not being too great 
Gifts also costs a bunch 
My point was that the website should offer something unique 
I do like BtL in Scapeshift to start with because the mana is awful and it super clunky but if I had to play it here how I would do so 
I think the best way to go is to splash lands just for BtL at least in the maindeck 
Your suggested manabase seems weak 
Keep in mind that this is a UG deck splashing colors 
As such here what I think you should be playing 
lands sounds appropriate given that we have more expensive sorceries 
Steam Vents Stomping Ground Mountain Valakut same mountain suite as before because Blood Foundry really suck Island Forest Breeding Pool Flooded Grove Misty Rainforest the core of your mana lands in your splash color Ux shockland Gx shockland basic 
This means Watery Grave Overgrown Tomb Swamp or Hallowed Fountain Temple Garden Plains 
I think the black SB cards are probably better to have access to and that having your fourth color fetchable by every ramp spell is important enough to play the basic 
If you want lands I think the cut is a Misty Rainforest 
Moving onto the spell suite I say the best combination of wincons is BtL and Scapeshift 
If there a version of Scapeshift that can cut from Cryptics it this deck but I like four 
Remand and Snaps seems fine as well 
As for ramp I agree that Farseek is necessary to fix the mana 
Search and Farseek should do nicely if a bit on the saturated side mana sources 
This leaves slots to mess with 
You might be able to get away with Bolts because the deck has more impact spells though I have liked Visions in its place 
A maindeck Roast for delve creatures and Goyf and Anger of the Gods are good to have as is Repeal to get out of tight spots 
I like Peer Through Depths over Anticipate in BtL Scapeshift because we have more ramp spells 
Those are the main ones that I have tried there are certainly others 
I did think of Worldly Counsel so props to you on finding that one 
Try playing against it a few times 
Perhaps you change your perception perhaps not 
The card is very difficult to beat out of decks that are doing something proactive or have additional interaction 
Something that does have 
I not a fan of Mutagenic Growth here as it is somewhat inconsistent without Wild Nacatl and only deals damage most of the time 
Strongly consider some number of Grim Lavamancer people usually play 
This card helps tremendously against all manner of decks providing reach against controlling decks and a major pain to Infect Affinity and Elves 
People have been moving towards some Skullcracks in the main deck 
I like removing the other two Mutagenic Growth at the very least followed by Helix if you want more Cracks 
The sideboard seems fine though the burn player I go to swears by Kor Firewalker and Molten Rain 
The style that you playing is inherently poorly positioned against Twin 
If you want to have a better matchup playing a more version will suit you better 
I think that Restoration Angel is the key to this matchup 
Blocks reasonably against their guys while you Path the Goyfs and having flash is crucial 
That combined with some value Remand your own spells use counters and removal judiciously should win a good share of games 
BanBlackVise 
With my small Legacy experience I say that it will probably shift the metagame towards decks that are better against Infect 
Sneak and Show is the obvious switch for OmniTell players and that deck usually has a bunch of Pyroclasms after sideboarding and a much faster and explosive kill 
Correct 
OP forgot to factor in that of Tron players are lucksacks 
In the average game of Modern let say you draw two copies of 
The second time you cast the spell Snag is better 
The first time Leak is better 
This average considers matchups against Grishoalbrand and matchups against Esper Control which is to say that what seems like an evenness between the cards is actually a lean towards Mana Leak being better 
Now take into account the importance of the first few turns of Modern games and the ability of certain decks to run you over before you get to turn 
Leak is better because it more useful when everyone is playing very cheap and powerful cards 
Most decks that are playing Mana Leak have no more than copies 
If you want Rune Snag you are more or less forced to play four if you want it to be better than Leak 
Even at that it only better sometimes 
You banking on drawing the second copy of this card which makes it inherently less consistent 
EDIT It also important that Mana Leak is better with Snapcaster Mage 
Today I pulled a foil prerelease promo Fold into Aether 
I also ripped off a speculator lucksack who opened a Steam Vents 
Why not XMage 
Does really matter 
They GQ the land that you only have one copy of which turns them all into lands 
GQing a Tower only matters if you have of each at which point you not hurt much 
Unravel the Aether is likely a better choice given that it a bit easier to cast 
Shuffling the card back in is usually fine as by the time it floats back to the top you have more mill rocks in play 
I in the hope to dodge camp 
Play zero Fulminator Mages and focus your sideboard to beat everything except Tron Scapeshift and Bloom 
That or maindeck your Fulminators 
You have to pick a direction and go hard because it is going to lose you percentage points other decks while not necessarily gaining much where you want the cards you sideboarding 
Or you know bring a playable sideboard 

My plan for Grixis Control in sideboarding is something like creatures Titan Surrak Baloth Tusk Negate Swan Song Boseiju for Cryptics Charms Repeal Into the Roil Electrolyze and Anticipate 
I not sure if keeping my Snaps is better than keeping some of these cards but Visions has been staying in 
me 
I disagree here 
I have been winning much more with Serum Visions than with Lightning Bolt and I say that if your sideboard is well built enough to hate out Affinity and Burn then the cantrips do a very good job in other matchups 
With Jund Abzan and Twin being popular I highly prefer having Visions in game 
That said I would be more inclined to bring Bolts to a big event just because there are a lot more random decks that it better against 
Well done 
The post is well organized and makes good points on card choices 
I also wrote a primer for Scapeshift http under a different username over on TappedOut so check that out if you interested 
It is a bit outdated but still useful 
Less popular now but still present is Jeskai Control though I not sure which category it fits into 
It rather unique in that it has burn spells but no other fast clock 
Not really 
GV exiles your fatty at the end of the turn and since Ulamog does do much attacking for and milling is in the end mediocre for what you looking for you are getting little to nothing for your investment 
Perhaps consider Jeff Hoogland Esper Goryo Gifts brew 
He playing Vengeance as a combo with Jace Vryn Prodigy and Obzedat Ghost Council both of which interact favorably with the exile at end of turn clause and make for a rather solid control shell 
While we at it this deck should be called GW Rhino 
I do even know why you playing Prairie Streams in an Abzan deck 
Rookie mistake 
No Ojutai 
For shame 
Scapeshift was basically the first thought that came to most people minds when they saw Bring to Light 
It works you do have to cut Mountains for black lands but it very likely too clunky to work 
Oath of Druids reprint confirmed already i know it good because Lewis Scott Vegas said so 
Scapeshift 
That probably the best one 
I figured it out 
It called having nothing to say 

Yep I know 
He just wanted the effect each turn 
Twinning a Clique does happen often but afterwards he told me he had or Twins in hand 
Inquisition is the better choice however most Grixis Twin players are moving towards discard spells in the maindeck and a couple of Thoughtseizes in the sideboard solely for combo matchups 
I was playing Scapeshift against a fairly stock UR Twin a few months ago 
Turn my opponent plays Clique and I Remand it but he sticks it on his following turn with Dispel for my Remand 
He takes a Scapeshift from my hand and sees no counterspells 
The following turn he Twins his Clique and proceeds to activate it on my draw step every turn for turns 
I do know how but I managed to win the game without ever killing his Clique 
I just kept drawing bomb after bomb 
Unplayable in Standard 
I tried that as well 
might be preferable depending on how much Zoo and CoCo decks one expects to play against 
My only recommendation is to include a Desolate Lighthouse in the maindeck to help filter those draws against slower decks 
I probably play a Loothouse anyway but I cut it recently because of mana issues 
Like I said the opportunity cost of playing a bunch of Bolts you can probably get away with is rather high IMO 
It does even help enough against the aggro decks as they all know how to beat it anyway 
Visions helps you find your matchup breakers postboard 
The coin flip against Jund is a lot harder to win when you do have Visions as well 
I do like playing Bolts 
I aware that many people disagree 
My logic is that playing Bolts does improve your matchup against aggressive decks enough to be worth the slots 
I prefer totally trashing them with haymakers in games and ensuring that we win game against 
I also got a GoyfShift list that built closer to 
I can provide my list on request but unfortunately I do have it handy ATM 
EDIT Here http my current build 
You can find a list of other card considerations at the bottom 
You notice that I cut all the ramp spells in favor of more interactive tools 
The idea behind this version was to be with fewer slots dedicated to the combo 
I have effectively slots for my combo extra lands and Scapeshift which leaves me two extra cards than most stock decks to play with 
The manabase might want extra Breeding Pools Flooded Groves or Islands 
The sideboard midrange suite can use work one might consider Jace AoT 
If you got an interesting update to the deck please share 
IMO no Scapeshift player should have Coiling Oracle or Augur of Bolas in their deck 
Oracle is worse than Explore because it more painful against Burn and does guarantee the extra land and I not playing Explore in the first place 
Augur feels super clunky at times and you have a surprisingly high chance to miss 
Searches and Bolts are frequently dead and Command are much worse when the opponent knows about them 
Gaining a bit of life is fine but I rather choose to lose to aggro by playing Anticipate or beat aggro by playing Lightning Bolt 
Right now I really like a build of the deck really it comes down to Visions over Bolt with a powerful sideboard 
Cantrips are the reason we have a favorable BGx and Twin matchup as Bolts are very poor in these matchups 
Add a mixed suite of interaction I like at least one Charm at least one additional bounce spell and at least one Roast Electrolyze is awesome and you have a solid maindeck 
As for the sideboard I agree for the most part 
Thragtusk has been stellar for me and Huntmaster is very underwhelming 
Boseiju is the key to the Twin matchup as nowadays they have infinite counters so playing a ton of cheap counters yourself does actually contribute much 
I not a fan of the variance of Bonfire are just fine for me 
I not a fan of Mystic Snake 
Keep in mind that boarding out Cryptics against heavy Dispel matchups is usually correct 
Tech I love me some Compulsive Research and Primal Command is sick against everything that is Affinity or UR Twin 
I ca imagine a world where I would play four Cryptics 
I played them even when Delver was top dog 
Having the most abusive Cryptics is an important draw to playing Scapeshift in the first place 
DAE none of them tap for mana idiot 
I just need one unban 
You can even give me that silly eight mana card that needs UU to cast 
Not really 
Logic Knot is the Jeskai deck attempt at keeping up 
Some players splash black for Tasigur and Souls however 
Check here http where you can also find match coverage from the GP 
I super excited to watch if only because I get to see Shaun Patrick and Reid do commentary 
LSV sounds like the kind of guy who will bring Compulsive Research and Repeal because they were at the GP 
What I mean is a build with Visions and no Gifts 
You could probably fit both cards into a list but that not what I have 
I prefer Shifts Ungiven 
Better ring to it and probably what going to happen when you resolve Gifts 
I worked on the deck quite a bit a few weeks ago and my conclusion was that it very similar to putting Restoration Angel in your Jeskai deck 
Both cards are solid against Jund and Twin but frequently leave something to be desired against aggressive decks 
Given that BGx is quite popular right now playing a Gifts package is solid 
I personally prefer a build but so long as you have access to sufficient tools to slow down Affinity Gifts will let you beat everything else 
EDIT Did a bit of research and apparently a bunch of people have been doing well at WMCQs with the deck 
Coolest tech was some nut playing Tree of Redemption 
Play Jeskai anyway and dunk on the scrubs who tried to disrespect Sphinx Revelation 
I remind you that we are in 
I expect that having your guys stay in play past your next upkeep is well worth not being able to hit Teysa or Witness 
I suppose Michael Majors' variant that had Liliana four Jaces and notably Blackcleave Cliffs counts as a fourth 
Agreed 
Abzan is favored in the BG mirror and slightly better against Grixis so that may be a selling point as well 
Tech for the mirror Haakon 
EDIT Fuck 
To be fair there were some pros in OKC 
I bet some of them saw a bit of the city after scrubbing out of the tournament 
Zac Elsik is literally my heroin 
Screw those netdecking speculator neckbeards playing Islands 
The key to the sideboard bombs is that they trump the creatures out of Jund and Grixis 
Jund already has access to both Olivia and Huntmaster so yours are really trumping theirs 
On the other hand Thragtusk can trade every creature in Grixis and Jund Titan and Wurmcoil straight up eat them 
The concessions to BtL make you a lot weaker in those matchups postboard 
The other black cards Pulse Duress Damnation Slaughter Games are really unnecessary IMO 
We do want discard because we have counterspells and the other effects are not great for the opportunity cost 
As for playing Visions and Bolt having so many spells means that you are cutting real meat out of the deck 
Either you are only going halfway on a good removal suite or you are cantripping into spells instead of more ways to find your kill cards 
Twin thrives on a tempo game and thus plays those cards but we have access to more mana and using a smaller fraction of it each turn is weaker than I like 
Souls is also great in the BG mirror especially when your opponent does have it Jund 
This depends highly on your archetype of choice as well as your definition of draw spell I do consider Visions a draw spell 
Slower blue decks have access to Cryptic Command 
control has Sphinx Revelation and Dragonlord Ojutai 
Snapcaster Mage is a very powerful form of card advantage 
Thirst for Knowledge and Compulsive Research are very powerful but restrictive in deckbuilding 
Remand is useable in a variety of shells as a good tempo play 
EDIT Gifts Ungiven too 
Outside of blue I say the best card advantage spells are Collected Company Kolaghan Command and Dark Confidant 
I think that you building the manabase wrong 
My take had the following Shocklands Breeding Pool Overgrown Tomb Watery Grave Steam Vents Stomping Ground Basics Forest Mountain Island Swamp Others Valakut Flooded Grove Misty Rainforest Blood Crypt is very bad with your ramp spells and Cryptic and the two black shocks cater better to the core colors of your deck 
We are a UG splash R deck 
Scalding Tarn is much worse than Misty because you ca fetch a basic Forest which you want more frequently than a basic Mountain 
I would play both Visions and Bolt 
Including more interaction over Visions is one way to go or playing cantrips over Bolt is the other 
Having both makes your deck a lot lower in power level and pulls it in different directions 
I do think playing four Bring to Light is the way to go 
I say that if anything you should have Shift and BtL though total copies might be the way to go 
We need certain tools such as Roast and Repeal to live to the kill condition and having another expensive sorcery and worse mana likely mandates a Farseek or two 
I do like such drastic change to the sideboard 
The black cards you added are very poor or unnecessary with possible exception to Slaughter Games and I think we would benefit from a straight RUG selection of cards that is similar to current sideboards 
In general BtL is as spectacular as you think it is 
Casting Cryptic Command for at sorcery speed is very useful and the sideboard cards that have CMC just to be findable with BtL take away from a potential selection of larger bombs and counterspells 
tl dr Build the deck less around BtL I think we should just be using it as additional copies of Scapeshift 
It might be useful to people if you sorted your maindeck by type so that we know what your removal suite looks like more cohesively etc 
I am a Scapeshift player I think you should have no less than Cryptics four if you can manage it 
are particularly popular around here and Cryptic is very good against them 
The cut is likely either your fourth Path or the Dispel 
As for Logic Knot having access to it and diversifying the counterspell suite sounds good to me 
I also think a third Electrolyze would be useful though it a tossup between that and the Think Twice IMO 
The manabase could use some 
I like playing five shocklands in this deck because your mana requirements are very tenuous and Sulfur Falls is really good 
I play another Fountain and a Falls over Island and Plains 
If you fear big mana decks a Tec 
Edge can take the place of the Loothouse 
The sideboard is solid overall 
I feel like either an Anger or a Pyroclasm over the Wrath would be better given that you have SV main and Thrun is common 
Elspeth Sun Champion has been good to me as a trump against BGx 
Twisted Image is excellent against Affinity it kills Signal Pest Ornithopter probably something else I forgetting in addition to Spellskite and when you are killing anything it nullifies a Plating hit 
It also great in the mirror killing Hierarch and Spellskite 
At worst it cycles 
Oh and you can them out with Rancor or get in a point with Pendelhaven or save a point in random places We really really need good answers to Spellskite 
Just four Nature Claim is enough 
Wut dis grammer 
The rules text on the card says This card has no color 
That just a characteristic it has in 
That means Servant can just change it right 
EDIT Misunderstood the mechanic 
He probably should have played to Wurm you in the face but well done 

My list is fairly stock 
I gone for a bit of a slower game with a maindeck Scrying Wild Defiance Spell Pierce and Dismember and am trying out the maindeck Twisted Image it exceedingly average so far 
You do lose to removal if you play around it and Spellskites fast kills are great 
You do mulligan well because you need certain pieces to even play a real game 
The deck can win turn on a mulligan to but anecdotes do matter 
When you are far behind the opponent has ample answers to your few threats and a clock of their own and it takes some good luck to get there 
I disagree 
Magic is my frame of reference 
You certainly right that Burn is much easier to play than other decks but again it still rather hard to play a perfect game with the deck 
You can say the same for anything yes so here I am saying it for Burn 
Like the OP said you do play the deck for particularly interesting lines of play 
That does mean it objectively easy 
Infect Pros Very fast kill Good against random combo decks Rather resilient to removal Cons Weak against a large amount of cheap interaction Mulligans poorly Difficult to come back from far behind 
Found the new guy 
Expect lots of Tier decks but have versatile answers so that you can beat random decks 
The metagame should be similar to your LGS but with Grixis Control and Twin making a much larger appearance 
provides a metagame breakdown that should be a reasonable baseline for your preparation 
They somewhat close as far as playstyle goes 
Both are very linear trying to kill the opponent with a small amount of creatures backed by pump effects 
To be honest it close to a coin flip for which one to choose 
I would say an optimal build of Infect is better overall than Hexproof but the decision really comes down to which one you enjoy playing more 
Also try to find more optimal versions of the decks 
Your Hexproof manabase could be better and the same for Infect along with some card choices 
Dam Son https 
I would say that the best options are either RWg just splashing green for sideboarded Destructive Revelry or Naya all four Atarka Commands sometimes Wild Nacatl as well 
Specifically Naya seems to be the better choice right now because Nacatl is pretty good in the mirror and makes Command even more nuts 
Rending Volley is the most playable one as it also does a very good job against UR Twin less so against variants but still solid 
Deathmark and Execute are similarly solid and you can even play Sulfur Elemental if you want 
However I think a better plan is to have sweeper effects specifically Engineered Explosives as it does hurt your strategy as much as Pyroclasm 
EDIT I missed Rough Tumble that a solid option as well 
Additionally use your removal thoughtfully 
That is do just kill the first thing that comes along unless it important and try to get additional value out of your Snapcasters and such whenever possible 
In general solid removal spells and a delve creature or two should get you there 
I still wonder if Distortion Strike would be better in that scenario 
You can simply save your pumps so that you can kill them over two turns and if they have a large amount of toughness Rancor might not even get the job done 
I say SCG has the best presentation as far as an appealing display goes but I agree that CFB does an excellent job as well 
I drawn three copies enough to feel just fine with four in the deck 
But as I said go nuts 

I suppose the bottom line is this The deck does need additional copies of the win condition and certainly does need to splash a fourth color if it wanted it 
Gifts Ungiven is plenty good as Scapeshifts most lists I see play copies 
You might be judging how hard it is to find the kill without having played the deck enough 
If you want to try it go for it 
I just entirely convinced that it wo work 
Bet you do have a foil miscut Judge Promo FiA like I do 
Having more clunky spells is not where I want to be 
Finding Scapeshift is sometimes an issue but with all the cantrips it is generally more of a problem living to cast it 
Since Bring to Light costs you either can only back up your kill with Remand on lands as opposed to Remand and if you want Cryptic or double Remand backup you need to get to which matters 
Using Bring to Light to get Cryptic Command and other instants is very good at all and I much rather have a cheaper spell that replaces itself while interacting with the board 
Beyond that splashing a fourth color is a very serious cost 
Cryptic Command and the ability to cast it on turn is very important to the deck as we abuse it the most 
We have to play a bunch of basic lands to search for with the ramp spells meaning that casting even the less restrictive spells can get hard 
I had enough games where I drew Stomping Ground Mountain Forest Desolate Lighthouse or something like that to want to add another color 
Oblivion Sower is just too slow and weak to even consider playing 
If I wanted this effect I be more explosive with Primeval Titan 
All the modes of Izzet Charm are good 
It interacts with early important spells kills nearly every creature in Affinity and Burn and loots in a pinch 
Dimir Charm is narrower Sultai Charm is hard to cast costs and is worse than either Roast or Compulsive Research 
Ojutai Command is even remotely playable in my Snapcaster Mage deck and as for the other modes they are also quite narrow 
As for Kolaghan Command that OK 
However we do abuse Snapcaster Mage as much as other decks do and our main plan is to kill them on not Snap back a Kommand 
WHO ARE YOU 

This is highly dependent on your local metagame 
Given that Burn is very popular I slightly prefer the Twin deck for the fast kill and extra cheap counterspells though if your sideboards for these decks are constructed so that the control deck has a bunch of cards to bring in that could change 
This http is a good one 
A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself 
Certainly helps but does for it 
In my experience Clique dies all the time 
If you draw two you simply trade off the first or attack until it dies and play your second one later 
Having power means that it generally will trade with an opposing creature which is great 
Agreed 
I do want more than in my because it rather narrow this is the main reason and is optimal against Hangarback Walker 
Have you tested it much 
Your answer to the question plus some reasoning makes for a good starting point 
IMO if you want to play a bunch of Pyromancers you really do need to build the deck like Delver 
Slotting in Pyromancer in a normal Grixis Control shell is potentially disastrous since it a generally higher curve 
Because of that Grixis Delver should be your starting point 
As for comparison I think it worse than the other variants 
Pyromancer is as busted here as in Legacy because the spells are more expensive and people play more creatures people play more cheap removal 
PS Nice grammar 
I think 
Not sure how Alarans do that stuff 
I sometimes feel guilty doing that to people 
What do you think about Collected Company in this deck 
Or Hangerbak Wochers 
It gone back up a bit in popularity recently 
The main reason it fell out of favor was that Jund and Twin gained Kommand which hurts a lot by making you discard and providing consistent value as you struggle to assemble your pieces 
Aggro decks mainly Burn and Affinity were also very popular and drove the deck down as well 
Losing a good matchup in Pod and having to face a diversity of fast combo decks was difficult as well 
Nowadays though I really feel that only Affinity Burn and Infect are unfavorable matchups and that the deck is a solid choice 
Certainly 
Note that people normally have Ricochet Trap in the board to deal with counterspells 
It is still very good against Jund I not sure about Twin so it is still reasonable against the Level decks 
The way Martin Mller explained it was that Living End is very good against the Level decks that is decks chosen to beat the expected popular decks such as Bogles while still being reasonable against the Level decks in Jund Grixis and Twin 
That said what ended up being the most popular deck in the room Affinity is a bad matchup 
My bad 
There might be though 

I do think it find a home in RG Tron 
As others will quickly point out standard versions of the deck only play creatures of sizeable power Wurmcoil Engine and Emrakul 
As for U Tron my memory of the deck would give the same conclusion 
Please correct me if my laziness screwed me 
I do Standard much but not many things are bigger than Dragons 
Perhaps Dragons decks could play this 
EDIT Whoops 
For me Magma Spray is pretty clearly the superior card right now 
Shaun McLaren did a deck tech at Worlds and he explained why pretty well when you are going to the face with Wild Slash chances are low that it actually going to kill someone 
Your control opponents are usually able to stabilize at and you plan to board this card out regardless against them 
However if you playing a particularly aggressive build I can see a split 
You tell 

Again it good if you play it at the right time 
Using it when you have ramp spells that you want to play is quite silly 
Casting it after you done with all of that is better 
As for the impact thing that reasonable but I suppose that the case for whichever cantrip you choose to play and sometimes for Bolt as well 
Not immune to Fold though 
No one is safe 
Hide yo' kids hide yo' wife 
Then do cast Visions on turn 
You should try to save it for after you done all the searching and setting up so that you can get full value from it 
Your deck seems to be all over the place especially as far as the sideboard goes 
I highly suggest looking at some shells from GP decklists from the past 
Most people will either go for a more controlling plan with Bolts or a more combo and plan with Visions but having both makes your deck a lot less powerful and spread a bit thin 
I believe that in building this deck you are locked into cards 
Here they are lands I like to play a Desolate Lighthouse and Flooded Grove among these and Misty Rainforest Wooded Foothills ramp spells between Tribe Elder and SfT Scapeshift Remand Cryptic Command You have to play these 
Some like to cut a Cryptic but I feel that it your best card in many matchups 
Snapcaster Mage feels like too few but you do have to play 
Roast Izzet Charm Electrolyze Repeal These interactive spells are all great 
You need Roast for Grixis decks Charm serves as removal and the fifth Remand while the last two let you interact with the game state while still working towards the kill 
Past that you can either go for Bolts or Serum Visions in addition to other spells or removal 
I currently like Visions because you do always need Bolt to beat the aggro decks and you sometimes lose even when you have it 
As for the sideboard a lot goes into making that up 
I suggest reading this a bit out of date but still useful for some tips as well as looking at decklists online 
Just in case it useful I leave my current sideboard here Engineered Explosives Anger of the Gods Shatterstorm Thragtusk Obstinate Baloth Surrak Dragonclaw Krosan Grip Dispel Counterflux Negate I hope this helped 
From my testing Augur of Bolas was simply awful 
The gains a bit of life but the digging aspect frequently misses you got Search for Tomorrows that you usually do want and even when you hit a Cryptic Command or Remand or something it a lot worse because your opponent knows about it 
Electrolyze is at least a generally two in pretty much every Scapeshift deck 
It does exactly what the deck wants to do impact the game state draw a card 
Izzet Charm is also very common 
Telling Time should very likely be Anticipate because it digs deeper 
I actually consider all the tier decks save Affinity and Burn to be favorable matchups but like you said you have to play the deck properly to have that be true 
I think that the mana advantage is good enough to beat all of the blue decks and Jund is naturally fine unless they draw Liliana 
My list is very close to Ken Van Sciver decklist http from the Open this past weekend 
My only changes to the maindeck are Might of Old Krosa Become Immense Groundswell and my sideboard is as follows Carrion Call Dismember Dispel Hurkyl Recall Nature Claim Spell Pierce Spellskite Twisted Image I think of the list as a rather than maindeck sideboard in many respects 
I know that right now I want four counterspells in the between Dispel Spell Pierce and Spell Snare Spellskites removal spells grindy cards between Wild Defiance Carrion Call Sylvan Scrying and other slower cards for resiliency and so on 
Depending on what you expect to see you can move cards around the maindeck and sideboard as needed 
I think you should be going for a fast kill over a ton of resiliency right now 
There are a lot of fast combo decks floating around that you have to race and so long as you are careful and play conservatively enough against the controlling decks you will be fine there as well 
That said I suggest getting in your own practice 
Only you can decide what is best suited to your upcoming event 
What about when I Sow it 
I suppose this is all a matter of semantics anyway 
I disagree that the control decks you describe are unfair decks 
They are doing anything outright broken and win by playing lands each turn trading etc 
What you describe in your reply to munyee is simply the way control decks normally play 
That is more or less fair Magic 
You never bring in all of them unless you playing agains Affinity 
I do bring in TI vs Twin and I do bring in Claim vs CoCo for example 
Having Image means you can kill Skite without having otherwise useless crap like Claim 
Even when it useless Image cycles 
What was that about miscommunication on the Internet 
I have played Wurmcoil or Batterskull in a while because of Kommand 
Even with the leftover guys getting my Wurmcoil destroyed feels really bad 
Have you found it worth that risk 
I suggest playing more card advantage tools to try and grind through their counterspells 
I find the matchup to be rather good because we are able to leverage a mana advantage and lots of their spells are rather ineffective against us 
Try to gain incremental advantages as the game goes on 
Challenge them if you can with Cryptic Command on a Tar Pit Snapcaster for Electrolyze or a cantrip and if possible save Remand for your own spells 
The battle is not on the board it is in your hands and if you can draw more cards you will win 
When it comes to sideboarding I swear by Thragtusk and Surrak 
I would fear the counterspells so much as your current SB suite is solid 
If you go for Gigadrowse play a second Flooded Grove over a Breeding Pool 
To add to this Abzan is able to dominate games where it can play two spells in a turn 
Rhino removal spell or something similar allows you to gain a big tempo advantage and it hard to do that if you are playing lands every turn 
Thanks 
This is a really good explanation 
Would a set of Gitaxian Probe help towards playing the deck more optimally 
As you said information is key and Probe also lets you get additional value out of your Mentor in situations like the one described above 
Can you explain a bit more why the deck is particularly demanding of perfect play 
I not sure why Mentor requires this more than any other deck especially Twin 
What are you planning on cutting for it 
If it a bomb I do think it worth it because nearly everyone can handle a and your matchup Affinity is fine while Birds of Paradise decks generally die to Anger 
Having it to beat Souls against Abzan might be OK but Abzan is the preferred BG variant right now 
What you looking for against the aggro decks you mentioned as well as Jund is time 
Augur does do a good job Jund in that it helps curb the discard effect of Liliana while also virtually gaining life by chumping a Tarmogoyf 
We just need the turns to build up lands and topdeck Scapeshift for the win which Augur can help find as well 
Of note is that it eats Dark Confidant 
That said I agree that there are better ways to be spending your turns 
It arguably the easiest deck to play perfectly but that does mean it not difficult 
I got the magic in me 
Ask this gentleman not to give you such an unpleasant and unfair playing experience and to kindly stop being a fat poophead Steve 
As for trying to win the game try to pile your board onto a manland to evade the wrath 
If that plan does come together your only real plan is a very fast kill 
I played Ayers' version for a bit and I hated it 
Augur felt really clunky and missed more frequently than you think 
You got spells but are ramp spells Scapeshift is only useful later on and Command become significantly worse when the opponent knows you have them 
I currently prefer playing other cantrips an extra Snapcaster and a Roast or two over the Augurs 
However my sample size was small and I could be convinced to play them 
As for the reason people are playing it I believe it meant to fight all the attrition sitting at the top of the metagame 
As you said getting a card and a blocker helps buy you time to get to your kill with appropriate counterspell backup 
Buddy Guy meet the FBI 
I definitely play Grixis Twin 
The deck is so versatile and combines the two angles that every relevant deck is shooting from right now free wins and Kolaghan Command 
I am confident that if you play and sideboard with it properly you can beat everyone in the room 
or Call Me Maybe would be better choices given the setting 
I like to discuss Carrion Call 
The card has been solid for me recently providing enough reach to squeeze the last points in against Jund and Grixis Control 
Not too shabby against Twin either 
Scapeshift for life 
You spelled Sulfur wrong 
But seriously thanks for this 
I have to disagree with your comments on large threats like Gideon or Ajani as with Clique and your game plan you can frequently protect it from an opposing combo kill or something 
Keranos was notably left out here and I think that is also worth thinking about 
It feels particularly good when I playing Froot Loopy Cinnamon Ascendancy Bloom 
Damn strai 
Boarding in Dismembers vs Burn is a death wish 
No Twisted Image best Skite answer is also odd 
Otherwise congratulations on your win 
Ah 
Yes 
That could be the issue 
My mistake 
Anticipate actually sees four cards between your draw step and the top 
I find that to be relevant 
Is the deck not fast enough to get under Tron 
What the average kill 
A couple of updates to that primer that are worth noting Anticipate is pretty safely a better choice than Telling Time now 
It digs deeper and is less awkward with shuffle effects 
The primer is missing Roast and Into the Roil maybe other things both of which can be great to answer some of the larger threats running around 
In the sideboard section Thragtusk is missing and I highly recommend playing it 
Primal Command is pretty cool as well 
I currently playing Roast and it been very good for me 
Into the Roil also helps deal with larger threats though that is uncommon 
I maindeck your Shadow of Doubt over another cantrip if you want to play it 
However it just is worth the slot when the other cards are more useful in a wider variety of situations 
The fact of the matter is that people are playing Slaughter Games right now and that a good thing 
Your creatures provide a way to stop the opponent from getting you to buy time and in the case of Titan and Surrak can win the game on their own 
I say Titan is the best option creature decks and while Surrak is great Twin 
Baloth and Thragtusk should also find room just because you need them to beat Burn 
Ideally I able to grind through their removal spells and land Olivia after the game has gone for a while 
Though as I said I not the most experienced Twin player and that may be wrong 
Additionally I expect them to board out some number of Bolts 
In my admittedly small experience playing Grixis Twin the Twin deck gets smashed handily by Control 
They have the answers to all of my creatures and spells and even though I have a combo for them to play around I also have mana and Twins that are frequently dead 
However postboard the matchup is about even when I side out the combo 
I find that my bombs Keranos Olivia and additional card advantage spells make these games easier 
I advise Scapeshift 
Your Tron matchup is very good and while the matchup against is really bad in game postboard you can bring in as many as Obstinate Baloth to shore it up 
I think you need to pick one direction and stick to it 
For example Become Immense and Simic Charm and Vapor Snag are very bad in a midrange deck while your higher curve and playsets of Leak and Remand are optimal for a tempo deck 
If you going for midrange cut the bounce spells and stuff for more meat 
Perhaps planeswalkers Shackles etc 
If you want to be an aggro deck make your spell suite leaner 
Scapeshift is great 
Always great 
Never bad 
Suspend those Search for Tomorrows like you mean it 
If only we could win a match 
Must have been brutal http 
Congrats 
I wondering how Rancor and Scrying were for you 
I have played with Rancor in a while because I hated it so much without Ichorclaw Myr 
Your thoughts on Needle and Fog would be appreciated as well 
Also why board in Dismember the control deck 
Agree wholeheartedly 
Try it out and see if you like it 
Ah one more thing Anticipate Telling Time 
Congratulations on the Top 
Your list is interesting 
I personally find maindeck Clique to be very lackluster and less than four Remand is very wrong IMO 
As for the manabase I prefer Flooded Grove and a Loothouse over a Mountain and Breeding Pool 
On the Jund matchup Your sideboard is not well equipped to deal with it 
Having more of the big creatures is great as your goal here is to have as many live topdecks when they inevitably whittle your hand down 
Early on you should be doing everything possible to get to lands including discarding Scapeshift to their Lilianas 
Once you have enough mana you can usually cast everything you draw so all the fat you boarded in in addition to Scapeshift and Cryptics get to do their work 
I generally board out cards that do cantrip as well as some number of Remands 
EDIT On sideboarding I do remember ever siding out Search for Tomorrow at least not in recent memory 
is the cut if you want to remove ramp spells and I do think it even correct to do so in the matchups that you did 
Cryptic Command and Remand are generally the first cuts against aggro decks while against controlling decks such as the Faeries that you played against your mana advantage is the key to winning 
Same here 
Just a tiny bit 
Deck Scapeshift Bane Blood Moon Fulminator Mage Deck Infect Bane Efficient removal Night of SideBoarding I do play Storm but probably something like Deck Storm Bane the banlist 
I like to discuss Carrion Call 
I have enjoyed playing the card and it been rather strong in my experience 
Some of the more attached members of the Jack and the Beanstalk fandom were devastated at the change to Fee Fo Fum 
The infamous street protests of A Long Time Ago have never been forgotten 
Because they are money natural predators 
That why we have seen much money growing since the war 
Shh Do tell anyone 
Last time was a nightmare 
Being a sorcery is damning because it more important to interact with Twin and Infect at instant speed than to kill planeswalkers 
Hell just play Glimpse the Unthinkable 

Dammit we doing this wrong 
I think you thunk I was trying to insult you 
I am subscribed but the subscription has done anything for me yet and I wondering when I will reap the benefits of those wasted milliseconds clicking the green button 
I believe the term fucking convent is oxymoronic 
Perhaps just moronic 
Are you asking why these events exist 
The reason for that is to provide a lower barrier to entry for players looking to play some competitive as far as FNMs go Modern without having to purchase their entire deck 
For example if you realize you do actually like playing Grixis Delver you can change your proxies to build Grixis Twin and work your way up to building that if it appeals to you 
Geist has been very very bad in my testing 
I splash white just for Path to Exile and that has worked well but the slots you give to Geist are just wasted IMO 
Just play more interactive stuff 
I never got in for more than poison but my biggest single hit was with a power Spellskite 
Wild Defiance in play Scapeshift 
Might Grudge Vines Grudge Blessing Repeal Vines 
I point out that Jund and Abzan are matchups in my experience better if you play more than cantrips 
The issue for Pod against Scapeshift was that the Scapeshift kill is a lot more resilient to interaction and is very difficult to actually stop 
Once they have lands if you got a Skite you dead whereas with Twin your Abrupt Decays do very serious work 
Since Scapeshift was a value plan it killed a lot more consistently than Twin as well 
I wondering why you chose to avoid a more style deck 
You have Supreme Verdicts but the win condition is White Sun Zenith 
I think that Gideon Jura synergizes very well with the way your deck intends to play out and the ideal scenario is Wrath Gideon and he very difficult to kill 
I think having him over the Zenith will help you a lot more though having some chump blockers and shuffling in is pretty cool 
Dig Through Time 
This is the best Dig deck hands down IMO 
Alternatively having Jace would help us a great deal though it would also help Twin a bunch 
The joke is you ca cross a vector and a scalar 
My cuts definitely include the Volleys and a Helix 
The last cut is either the Crack or the second Helix because I think Lavamancer is necessary to shoot down all the small creature decks and have a good game vs the blue decks 
I leaning towards cutting the Skullcrack assuming that you have the full set of Atarka Commands 
The list you have linked is a variant of Valakut decks that some call Makeshift 
It is a lot more than other variants as it is trying as hard as possible to turboramp into a Primeval Titan and try to cheat all sorts of things into play by ramping and casting Through the Breach or Trap 
The more common variant of Valakut decks is called Scapeshift which plays like a control deck 
A set of Remands and Cryptic Commands let you slow your opponent game plan down while you accelerate your mana to cast Scapeshift with lands in play 
I say this variant is the most consistent and competitive as it can defend itself very well and is rather flexible 
The key reason why the deck is super popular right now is because Pod a great matchup was banned and the Twin decks are no longer as good a matchup as they used to be 
Kolaghan Command can be a serious beating against us 
Add that to the natural weakness against aggro decks and Scapeshift can have a tough time 
It sad really because I love the deck 
It would appear that you stole my joke 
Jerk 
It really because is deathly afraid of 
I have a Temple Garden in my maindeck 
A couple of people say that they dislike Roast 
I personally am a big fan of the card as it is the most efficient answer we have to delve spells and Tarmogoyf 
Those are really the only way Jund and Delver can race us so I like having a solid answer in the maindeck 
Scapeshift should be very well positioned in your metagame 
Tron is a good matchup which can be made better by Negate Counterflux and Ancient Grudge postboard and Grixis Delver is slightly better than in my experience 
For Delver sideboard cards like Thragtusk and Inferno Titan have been good for me because they the delve creatures which again are your only real issues 
Zero waste http 
There a lot of variance in the decklists 
For example I only play fetches because I also include a Temple Garden in my maindeck 
I certainly like the idea of a spreadsheet but I think this is something each player should do for their own metagame and their own deckbuilding 
My current SB is Spellskite Wild Defiance Carrion Call Dispel Hurkyl Recall Nature Claim Path to Exile Spell Pierce Spell Snare Twisted Image Sylvan Scrying Of note is that I have Spellskite in the main Defiance in the main and one each Pierce and Path in the main 
I like having counterspells Spellskite and Defiance in the right now and have split them up appropriately to have access to a variety of stuff in my maindeck 
I think the right place for the Dryad Arbor is in the maindeck because Jund is at the top of the metagame 
No basic Island because it clunks up too many draws 
My current manabase I splash white for Path to Exile green fetchlands Breeding Pool Forest Temple Garden Dryad Arbor Pendelhaven Inkmoth Nexus I also got a Sylvan Scrying in the SB 
I always found it super clunky 
It sort of like Izzet Charm Does some good things but you never really happy with the effect for the cost 
That especially important for us since over the course of a whole game we might only have access to mana or so 
Spending two for a bounce effect or a bad pump spell is certainly not worth it IMO 
Regarding your current decklist I highly highly advise four Cryptic Commands 
We are the best Cryptic deck in the format and it a really powerful card that I am always happy to see 
Going lower to the ground with the cheap counters is OK for the Twin matchup but otherwise you will really miss the power of Cryptic 
I also must recommend playing Repeal because it contributes to finding your combo pieces while also letting you slow the game down 
The manabase could use some work as well Cascade Bluffs is better off as Flooded Grove because we are a base UG deck and Wooded Foothills Misty Rainforest is optimal if you can afford it 
Regarding matchups The deck is too right now 
We have a slightly favorable match BGx and a good matchup Tron but otherwise it can be rough 
Having a good sideboard really fixes that 
My current SB contains Dispel Engineered Explosives Firespout Gigadrowse Inferno Titan Krosan Grip Negate Obstinate Baloth Primal Command Shatterstorm Surrak Dragonclaw Thragtusk I really like having access to several haymaker sideboard cards like Shatterstorm and the fatties 
Playing weaksauce cards like Rending Volley and Spellskite does fit my style 
In this deck I rather have every card do something big or contribute to my kill because we need cards to actually win the game 
Surrak and Gigadrowse in particular have been excellent against all the blue decks 
Random tips Always float mana when you cast Scapeshift 
This way you leave up interaction after Scapeshift resolves for their bounce or other interaction 
The rule of thumb for damage is that you can deal a maximum of Mountains left in your deck Valakuts you have access to in play or in deck 
Even if you draw a bunch of Mountains keep this rule in mind 
The reason I have never played BUG not even before Become Immense became popular is this You do need Plague Stinger and the other black cards are better than the cost of playing them 
Right now I rather play Sylvan Scrying than a Stinger because Nexus is a much more resilient threat 
The hurt to your manabase is real in BUG and when the key card you get out of black is at all worth it the splash is worth it 
As for Decay and Thoughtseize the two most common black cards people splash for I dislike those as well 
Discard spells do really have a place in Infect because cheap counters like Dispel Spell Pierce and Spell Snare play the protection role so much better 
Sure they only deal with removal but you do care about much else AND they have to invest mana into their Terminate or Kommand generally more than you spend to counter it 
Decay is certainly a useful and versatile spell but again here I have never wished I had it 
I honestly ca give a good argument against playing it but if it the only card you splashing for you can go without it 
Finally I do like that BUG is a lot slower 
You have extra and proactive discard after board in addition to a manabase which can be difficult to get set up properly in a reasonable timeframe 
Fetching multiple shocklands vs 
Burn matters and Blood Moon hurts even more for you 
TL DR Not worth 
You can be whatever you want to be as long as you believe in yourself 
And all of them have had either or loves before you 
Nice punch line 
Sounds like you got some emotional baggage 
It poorly positioned but tuning can seriously help you out 
If you have access to Spellskites and Wild Defiances and counterspells you can really do well against the Grixis decks 
Maindecking a removal spell or two deals with Melira and most other decks are reasonable matchups 
I bet Jimmy feeling rather rustled 
Tasigur is a very good card against decks that ca easily remove him usually decks without black or and is frequently a better topdeck than the other value spells because he will be a huge body on an empty board 
Huntmaster is good against creature decks gaining life and providing creatures to trade with theirs 
If he flips the game turns tremendously in your favor as a against most aggro decks is a monster 
Olivia and Chandra both shine against particularly Affinity if you can stall the game out for a bit and are also good trumps in the mirror 
I might also consider Pia and Kiran Nalaar which is even better against Affinity if you find that to be popular 
Your split seems fine 
Some lists will play Dismember as an additional answer to Tasigur over a Decay 
This is mostly based on how you play the deck 
If you want to be aggressive play more Treetops 
If you want to have a bigger threat in the mirror play more Ravines 
sounds like the right number 
I agree with the above manabase 
My version has a Darkslick Shores over Sulfur Falls to help with the black mana and it has played very well for me 
Send this to ten people in the next hour 
I nevah undistood why people think we Bostonians talk like this 
Pahk the cah in Hahvuhd Yahd 
HeHe 
Conditional probability friends 
Killing mathematicians each and every day 
Depends on what you call plan B 
The lifegain bros are really a plan against Burn they just stabilize 
Affinity is too fast for us to bring in four and five drops 
Slaughter Games is played in anything right now so it sort of 
I do always sideboard the beatdown against BGx 
I just saying that the actual card is worth the sideboard space 
We are trying to snipe their fetches 
We have sweepers to kill the creatures they would Chord for 
Tron is already a good matchup 
What do you mean by protecting the win 
Shadow does do that 
Heh I bet those first two animals did know that they could have chosen answer B 
That joke was soda good 

What do you call a churchgoing zoophilic electrician 
A 
Day Undoing is not very good from my limited experiences playing with it 
I would bother too much with graveyard hate 
Relics at the very best but one should suffice 
Farseek is more popular now because we need to kill faster 
There are a lot of fast combo decks and so by going for our own quickest kill possible we can combat them while stalling their plan with Remand and such 
If you know for a fact that Slaughter Games effects will be popular Shadow can be worth it 
Otherwise there are much options 
I prefer Tusk and Baloth because you can side those in for other matchups never played Feed myself 
The clock from the creatures has won me some games however 
Knife one 
Perhaps a bit forced 
good try 
Surrak is awesome 
I had resoundingly positive experiences with him in my sideboard 
Tribe Elder is very rarely a card in fact 
I only do it really against an opponent with trample creatures or against Twin if they already on or something like that 
Another good card this deck to keep in mind is Molten Rain normally out of Burn decks 
Regarding Slaughter Games I do think you need to fear the card that much as very few decks if any are playing it and its ilk right now 
When it comes to enchantment hate Krosan Grip is my card of choice 
It kills the Blood Moon no questions asked and the removal of multiple copies is rare enough that I rather have a guaranteed kill spell 
Into the Roil is solid as well 
If you play Lightning Bolt sure 
I do like playing it a whole lot 
If I do 
My comment about ramping was that you generally are doing that early on and if you are dealing with their guys instead the ramp spells can get a bit awkward 
Send to Sleep is OK 
Basically 
Haymaker card that does a huge amount of work when it shows up 
Shatterstorm against Affinity Blood Moon against Amulet Night of Soul Betrayal against Infect 
That sort of thing 
I definitely want at least the third Languish and the third Bile Blight in there 
The biggest issue with the deck for me is that it too linear 
You ca board into Keranos Jace or something similar because the deck devotes too many cards to a fast combo kill 
Because of that it very easy for people to beat you if they understand how your deck works and are prepared for fast fragile combo decks as they should be right now 
That is to say that a strong pilot ca take down an event but I just do like the extreme lack of versatility 
The biggest problem for Scapeshift is decks 
Burn Affinity Zoo and others including very fast combo decks can get you dead before you can properly set up because your interaction does really come online until turns because you spend the early turns ramping 
For this reason sideboards frequently contain sweepers and lifegain such as Thragtusk and Obstinate Baloth as well as cheap counterspells for Burn 
One of the ideas of the sideboard is to turn into a different kind of deck against people who bring in hate cards like Slaughter Games 
Baloth Tusk Inferno Titan etc 
can win games on their own or at least buy you time to get to mana and find your kill 
Another idea is to play a bunch of haymakers 
We get to do that because Scapeshift makes a lot of mana We get to play a lot of really powerful spells ahead of time 
Shatterstorm is the headliner for this plan but even Boseiju and Gigadrowse serve as incredibly difficult to beat endgame spells 
Hopefully this helped 
I like you can derive me all night and I only get bigger 
I also in favor of Anticipate 
Think Twice is solid for bridging the gap if you do have a turn play but given that people are doing all sorts of threatening things you might not find a window to flash it back for a while 
The decision also depends on what your expected metagame is 
I certainly recommend Think Twice for a metagame but if you are preparing for a field full of aggro and combo decks Anticipate sounds like the right choice 
The matchup should be very favorable for you 
Sometimes they can slow you down a ton with discard but you topdeck really well and the explosiveness of your deck should be enough 
When it comes to sideboarding Thragtusk and Hornet Queen and Leyline of Sanctity come to mind 
Those are all really good and attrition tools 

Hive Mind 
No Amulet stuff just plain old Hive Mind with Pacts or so 
Good fun 
The splash has never been worth it to me 
The deck does need additional threats in Plague Stingers and enough decks have access to flying blockers that the evasion is as good as one might think 
As for other black spells like Decay and Thoughtseize UG still plays Dismember those are the best either IMO 
I prefer making them invest in their removal spells and then countering them with rather than having to spend mana on my turn playing discard 
Decay is certainly very powerful but if that the only benefit black has I comfortable staying out of it 
Scapeshift and Infect Scapeshift a bit more often 
We all know Infect is powerful and I been playing it for around a year and a half and loved it the whole time 
It super explosive but also gets to play a lot of protection effects that mess with your opponent interaction 
Spell sequencing and planning are very important 
It weaknesses are a large suite of cheap as well as discard effects but hopefully you can address this with a good sideboard 
Scapeshift is great if you building the sideboard right 
The deck gets to play a control role but with a proactive endgame meaning that you never actually have to kill everything they have 
You just need to get to mana and go for the kill 
It a rather slow deck and as such loses to Burn and Affinity an unsettling amount of the time 
I think the reason to play Scapeshift is the sideboard You get access to more spells than anyone including giant creatures and more consistent Shatterstorms and strong cards like Gigadrowse and Boseiju 
Heh but anal 
Thanks for your advice 
I think the effective cantripping Therapies and knowing when to go for it are a function of familiarity with the format which I working on 
The rules of thumb are good to keep in mind as well 
Thanks for the detailed explanation 
I been having difficulty making sense of the flex slots people were using though it was fairly obvious that slots were locked and your reasoning is very helpful 
Did notice that those were there 
Thanks 
That was dark 
Expect the boos to come rolling in 
Thanks for making my job such a pain in the bass 
I think the joke is that a peeping tom watches a pickpocket snatch a peck of pickled peppers 
Depending on how many slots you have to devote to these cards I try to play at least one of each but more Finks than Tusks 
Thragtusk is a bit better in the BGx mirror than Finks so keep that in mind as well 
Sideboarded Melira Sylvok Outcast may not be unworth it against Infect 
Not necessary at least in my experience unless of course your opponent is playing Twin 
If you have Wild Defiance preferably then you should be able to get the incremental beats plan going pretty consistently 
Ah shit 
What was I even expecting 
Heh 
I like to treat any Grixis deck as a hard control deck 
This means I siding into as many additional threats counterspells and protection spells as I can 
I avoid bringing in Nature Claim because I do think it worth having three totally dead cards otherwise in your deck and you can beat their of EE by playing around it 
Your approach should be to try and push in points where you can and keep your creatures safe from removal 
If they tap out then obviously go for a big punch but otherwise try to get in the ones and twos where you can and be conservative 
There will be points where they land a delve creature and start attacking and at that point there is much you can do but attack 
You have a faster clock so removal is not necessary 
I think another Wrath is just better against Hatebears than Torpor Orb 
Eventually their beats will just kill you even if the ETB effects were nullified 
Your revised sideboard looks alright though I do think the Geists would be worth it anymore 
Here https is a recent set of videos of Esper with a guy who did really well with it at Charlotte maybe you can take something away from his list or the games 
I argue that MTGO has a much more attractive and natural user interface 
Consider for example the pain in the butt that is graveyard access on current XMage 
If that does matter to you though you absolutely correct 
That fair 
However I think the fraction of people who would play on anything but MTGO is a great deal smaller than that of people who would be able to play were the tournament played through MTGO 
That just my guess though 
There also the nonzero effect of people worrying that MTGO will be voted as the platform of choice and thus stay away 
I figured your reason for all the shocks was that Esper Charm costs triple colored mana as opposed to Electrolyze 
I not sure how many you think you can afford but my cuts from that manabase would probably be Island Plains Darkslick Shores Drowned Catacomb Glacial Fortress Ghost Tar Pit 
You could also try the ninth fetchland 
I not a big fan of the filter lands just because they are less consistent than the check lands and Choke is really a big deal in the grand scheme of things 
Torpor Orb is pretty poor 
I cut that for the Flashfreeze and find a better card than the second Orb 
Either you trying to beat Twin play another cheap removal spell or you trying to beat CoCo play another wrath 
I think it better to have a powerful card against either than a much weaker card against both 
I like your reasoning on the postboard Geist of Saint Traft plan 
Seems rather unnecessary to me 
Your manabase also seems a bit strange so many shocklands and I like to know why you built it the way you did 
As for dealing with those enchantments I would slightly change how you play but not seriously alter your sideboard to cope with them 
You can certainly play around Blood Moon with your fetchlands and Choke is taken care of by Flashfreeze which I highly recommend 
Dirty cheater 
I figured 
Thanks 
Got that but still do get why that would prompt the wife to give her a raise 
I think the idea is that as many people as possible should be able to participate even those who ca want to use MTGO for whatever reason 
Do be surprised at the cold stares you get 
Nice 
Read again still do not understand 
Please 
I need a good matchup 
Also Dig if you be so kind 
Ah 
You are correct 
That deck plays Scalding Tarn though 
Carrion Call comes in against basically any deck whose main goal is to kill all of your guys and then win with whatever they have as opposed to presenting their own proactive game plan 
Being instant speed means it actually rather strong against Twin and making two more threats against Jund and other decks is very powerful 
Other people will go for alternative grindy options such as Sylvan Scrying or even Blight Mamba which I had success with before 
Call has the advantage of being instant speed and getting around sorcery speed removal and Liliana but can be rather clunky 
Rick Roll 
This should be a thing 
You appear to be playing a pretty stock list so your mulliganing issues are likely either variance or poor mulliganing decisions 
I suggest reading some pieces on Affinity by people like Karsten and Majlaton who I sure have included mulligan guides in their work 
Also learn to mash or riffle shuffle 
It would appear that my understanding of the different Loam variants is lacking 
Would you say that this card would replace Seismic Assault in the decks that do play that card 
If you were casting Seismic Assault before you should probably be able to activate Molten Vortex times if you want to right 
What you need is as fix for that sailor mouth of yours 
I know that 
However Fulminators can let you steal games sometimes and the matchup against Twin is good enough that I think it a solid choice for the OP metagame 
I still advise Infect or Affinity because both of those decks have a solid Tron matchup and are against Twin 
To be fair it did have protection from tcglkn 

Sure it is 
It just a and needs some other pieces of metal 
Also helps beat other problem matchups kill manlands etc 
But unless they kill you faster they literally can not beat Eye of Ugin Emrakul 
You just hold your Eye until you can play and activate it to find so that they ca just Tec 
Edge it 
At least in theory 
Conventional wisdom and probably results would show that control decks are generally good matchups for you 
What makes you say otherwise 
UWR sounds excellent for you given that they ca really beat Emrakul 
What kind of girl lants to get leighed 
Rick was so hated that people soon replaced him in their Christmas tradition 
Screw you Rick 
Cast Grapeshot from your hand he Counterfluxes it 
Then flashback Past in Flames which now gives you access to both of your Grapeshots the one you cast and the one you milled 
Am I missing something 
Or maybe that what you did anyway 
Try playing Jund with a few maindeck Fulminator Mages 
Alternatively play some really aggressive deck maybe Infect or Burn or Affinity with a serious Twin sideboard plan or maindeck hate Spellskite is great in Affinity or Infect maindeck 
Sure but flashing back Past in Flames should still get you there correct 
I play Counterflux sometimes mostly just to trump the blue mirror 
It incredibly average against Storm 
I believe you are allowed to use a handwritten sideboard guide on a sheet of paper most likely but using mobile devices is not allowed 
Look out guys he trained in gorilla warfare 
He gon na go on your ass 
If you looking for actual hate Vampiric Link is pretty cool 
You can tape it to their Eidolons for value or your own guys 
But actually I do get it 
I ai fuckin' you either 
You got Visions and cantrips to find your guys 
Really your goal is to cast two removal spells a threat Pyromancer or ideally a delve spell and the cheapest counterspells you can get 
You have cantrips and such to find your threats and answers so there no aggressive mulliganing needed 
Do you just Grapeshot then flashback Past in Flames to recast it 
I not convinced that this is better than Thragtusk 
Gifts Midrange decks will play some number of Knight of the Reliquary 
However these decks also normally run Tarmogoyfs 
Note that this is different from Gifts Control though I suppose you could toss some Knights in there if you wanted 
You might just have to straight up replace Liliana with some other value engine maybe Huntmasters but Tarmogoyf can become Putrid Leech and Bob can become Phyrexian Arena 
I think the answer is just to cast a on turn and Dispel everything 
The delve creature as early as possible is the key 
No matter what I happen to be playing I always have fun playing against Jeskai 
Such a good time 
Two decks I absolutely loved to play against were Pod and Jeskai Control 
Not just because what I normally play Scapeshift had a great matchup but because both of those decks offered legitimately awesome interaction between both players and a lot of room to maneuver and have a good time thinking about the right play 
As if it always my fault 
Yeah I been playing it for two years but never have actually bought in 

Josh did very well at a GP with Nacatl Burn I believe 
That may be worth exploring 
Just Nacatls though no Goyf 
That kind of thing I done before 
What I thought you meant was winning with Snapcasters and Bolts and stuff which I do remember doing much if at all 
But we only unbanning Dig for Scapeshift remember 
Jace would also be amazing in Twin and ai nobody got time fo' dat 
Agreed 
Scapeshift 
Dig Through Time Instant Delve Look at the top seven cards of your library 
Put two in your hand and the rest on the bottom 
I have suffered too long 
Got ta pig out on them while you still can 
Still low percentage though 
I suppose you got ta do what you got ta do to stay alive 
Changes all the time 
I currently playing a version with Gifts Ungiven which opens up some cool lines and strong sideboarding into an attrition plan 
The list is something like lands incl 
Loothouse ramp spells Tribe Elder SFT Gifts Scapeshift Cryptic Command Snapcaster Mage for real gas Electrolyze Charm Bolt Repeal Snare Roast Noxious Revival Remand for interaction SB EE Baloth Thragtusk Surrak Grudge Dispel Krosan Grip Negate Swan Song Boseiju Anger Firespout Shatterstorm 
I do nomally play Bolt in my list so this has actually never come up in my experience 
Sounds pretty to win that game 

I won games where the opponent has wasted spells getting rid of Scapeshifts only to lose to a Baloth or Thragtusk 
Good times this deck 

Heh you got him there 
That was dark 
Because then they have to cite the source 
You know scientists always wanting the credit 
Makes sense 
Thanks for the videos 
forget 
Naya Screw Blue 
Four Path to Exile to let them go get their Islands while killing their delve creatures four Boil other cards incl 
something to kill them with 
My first thought was Hexproof 
Goes over the top of all the creatures and the counterspells can only do so much 
Thoughts on Huntmaster of the Fells or Voice of Resurgence 
You may have talked about it but your reasoning on not playing those cards would be appreciated 
The Titans 
Chandra is solid 
Be aware of your CMC though and test with different configurations of flex slots 
Most people choose to play six discard spells and four Lilianas so those could be your two additions 
Alternatively Kitchen Finks is pretty great 
I still hate you and your stupid red cards 
Let me fetch Breeding Pools dammit 
First thing I would settle on a sideboard 
If you can purchase a bunch of different options so that you can adjust 
I do think you can safely play two Tasigur and two Olivia with Dark Confidant 
I play one of each max 
The manabase could use work 
I play four shocklands maximum Overgrown Tomb of each of the others because you have fetchlands to get them and playing more is very painful 
Otherwise the list seems solid 
Remember that Jund is all about how you tune your list so there is a specific idea to stick to 
That awesome 
I wish I had your patience 
For me buying into a deck forced me to love it 
I enjoyed playing Scapeshift online but when I actually invested in the deck and had to play it at FNM and such I grew to like it even more 
Hopefully that the same with Infect which I working towards building IRL 
I told that being gay is legal now 
Or something like that 
Saw a variant of this on Big Time Rush I think 
Try practicing all sorts of scenarios with regards to lands 
Learn to play around Tec 
Edge Ghost Quarter Cryptic Command etc 
The rule of thumb generally is that the amount of damage you have left is Valakuts in play Mountains in deck 
I suggest creating a list of sideboard cards from all the resources you have access to just so that if the metagame shifts later on you know the cards that you have access to in order to beat those decks 
I love to share mine with you if you interested 
Learn the normal play patterns of the deck 
I will generally only cast Serum Visions if you choose to play it after I done searching and such to ensure proper deck manipulation and other such sequencing things will become natural as you play the deck more 
Practice is the key 
Additionally try and understand where the deck is coming from 
Lots of people prefer to play a great deal of cantrips myself included rather than more removal spells like Bolt and still others switch around the cantrip suite to be more based on Anticipate and Visions rather than Peer Through Depths 
Try and figure out which metagames each variant is best suited to and you be golden 
People do play Assault Strobe and I do think Battle Rage is particularly better 
Any other pump spell has generally been better for me than a double strike effect 
My thoughts exactly 
This card is very similar to Proteus Staff though and so I hesitant to say that it particularly good 
Noticed that but for the the Breach style decks finding your kill is half the battle 
Not sure if it worth building around though 
Could just be that this is better in a deck 
Is this just asking you to put one creature in your deck preferably Emrakul or some other fatty and engage in shenanigans 
Scrolled down 
Was disappointed

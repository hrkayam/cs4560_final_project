I would probably recommend the first one to start out with the Anniversary remastered edition 
Fable has a very good story but fable is a much bigger in making it your own with an open world and more customization for characters 
OP I highly doubt that when he said they he meant all Italians 
He was probably being hyperbolic referring to particularly those that he interacted with in his community 
Also from the way you frame it it seems like he was referring mainly to the past 
I would try Diablo for the switch if you like RPGs 
Dont worry too much about it 
Everyone goes through the same feeling when they first move from single player story driven games to online gaming 
You need to be willing to reach out 
There are probably people in your clan who would be more than willing to help out if you reach out 
Just take the first step and say hey I did understand what I should be doing can someone please help me out 
Also do box yourself in like everything in life this takes time and practice to get better at 
Have you tried games like Fable 
Because I remember that was always a good time when I played it with my brother 
I recommend when trying to learn say that you are learning into the chat at beginning of the game 
It does wonders especially if you are playing games 
Most people wont flame you after this even if you make mistakes during the game because they have the expectation that you will make mistakes 
I have done it quite a few times when I play champions that I have never tried before 
You may still get a few people who flame you no matter what and muting them is an option 
They are saying USG schools will be shut down for the next two weeks according to https https 
They mainly closed due to the exposure from the bio tech conference that happened in Cambridge near MIT 
At the conference one person tested positive for the coronavirus 
So with an abundance of caution they are canceling classes 
Massachusetts has cases assumed to be positive 
So they decided to cancel 
Sad thing is they probably wo give enough funding until the first US citizen dies from the virus on US soil 
By then it will be too late
